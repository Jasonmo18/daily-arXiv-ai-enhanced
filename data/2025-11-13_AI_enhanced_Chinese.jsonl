This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5316SNAM\u80fd\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5de5\u5382\u7ed3\u6784\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408OCR\u3001\u89c6\u89c9LLM\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691%\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c93%\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7b80\u5316MGM\u7528\u6237\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528OCR\u3001\u89c6\u89c9LLM\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5de5\u5382P&ID\u56fe\u7eb8\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5382\u5c42\u6b21\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5168\u65b0\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u6df1\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5382\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091%\uff0c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u738793%\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea680%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cdAI\u6280\u672f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u5382\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u6e90\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u5634\u5507\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5634\u5507\u53d7\u5230\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7531\u9a71\u52a8\u97f3\u9891\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u9759\u9ed8\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u5339\u914d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u9ed8\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5634\u5507\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8eab\u4efd\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts.

Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants.

Vogelstein"], "title": "Optimal Control of the Future via Prospective Foraging", "comment": null, "summary": "Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate.

This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm.

A paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it: planning through belief-intent co-evolution", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by \"temporal fuzziness,\" enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination.

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes.

Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u725b\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NP-Newton\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08FPNO\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u5230\u89e3\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u725b\u987f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u505c\u6ede\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08FPNO\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u5230\u89e3\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1f\u6b65\u957f\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86NP-Newton\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e38\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "NP-Newton\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u725b\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With its clinical importance and steep dose-response, the spinal cord is an ideal model for evaluating FLASH effect on late toxicity. This work introduces a robust image-guided research platform for high-precision irradiation at both CONV and UHDR to enable FLASH late toxicity studies using a rat spinal cord model. Approach: A modified LINAC was employed to irradiate the C1-T2 rat spinal cord with 18 MeV UHDR and CONV beams. A custom rat immobilization device, a portable X-ray imaging system, and an ion-chamber-based UHDR output monitoring system were integrated to ensure accurate C1-T2 localization and precise dose delivery. A Monte Carlo (MC) dose engine was developed to provide accurate dosimetry and support interpretation of in vivo results. Scintillator measurements were performed within the spinal cord to verify MC results and the precision of our platform. Results: We achieved submillimeter C1-T2 setup accuracy and maintained submillimeter intrafraction motion. Ion chamber readings showed linear correlation with UHDR output. MC indicated uniform irradiation along the central ~13 mm cord. Our CONV beam exhibited distribution close to that of the UHDR beam, with difference <3%, isolating dose rate as the only variable. Scintillator-measured dose agreed with MC within 4%, confirming both MC accuracy and the platform's high-precision delivery. Significance: We developed the first comprehensive, image-guided preclinical platform for accurate UHDR and CONV irradiation to investigate FLASH-mitigated spinal cord toxicity in rats. This work thus establishes a robust foundation for systematic evaluation of the FLASH effect in late-responding organs and for determining clinical applicability of FLASH.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8d85\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7387\uff08UHDR\uff09\u548c\u5e38\u89c4\u5242\u91cf\u7387\uff08CONV\uff09\u7167\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76FLASH\u653e\u7597\u5bf9\u5927\u9f20\u810a\u9ad3\u7684\u665a\u671f\u6bd2\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "FLASH\u653e\u7597\u5728\u665a\u671f\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u5b98\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u810a\u9ad3\u56e0\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u9661\u5ced\u7684\u5242\u91cf-\u53cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30FLASH\u5bf9\u665a\u671f\u6bd2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u826f\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7167\u5c04\u5927\u9f20C1-T2\u810a\u9ad3\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u56fa\u5b9a\u88c5\u7f6e\u3001\u4fbf\u643aX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7535\u79bb\u5ba4UHDR\u8f93\u51fa\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u5242\u91cf\u5f15\u64ce\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5242\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7684C1-T2\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7684\u5206\u6b21\u5185\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7535\u79bb\u5ba4\u8bfb\u6570\u4e0eUHDR\u8f93\u51fa\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u6cbf\u4e2d\u592e\u7ea613mm\u810a\u9ad3\u7684\u5747\u5300\u7167\u5c04\uff0cCONV\u548cUHDR\u675f\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5c0f\u4e8e3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30FLASH\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u665a\u671f\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u5b98\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u786e\u5b9aFLASH\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets.

MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08AA-MAMORL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u79c1\u6709\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u52a0\u5267\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5728\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAA-MAMORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6548\u7528\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5728\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u72ec\u7acb\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684MAMO Particle\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6807\u51c6MOMALand\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u597d\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AA-MAMORL\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0cAA-MAMORL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o.

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p \u03c3_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u9635\u4f4e\u79e9\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u2016A\u0303_p - A_p\u2016\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8861\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u504f\u659c\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635A\u0303 = A + E\uff0c\u800c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662fA\u0303\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u79e9p\u903c\u8fd1A\u0303_p\u800c\u975eA_p\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u2016A\u0303_p - A_p\u2016\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u9635E\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u77e9\u9635A\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u504f\u659c\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728A\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u77e9\u9635\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This single-center retrospective study included 131 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients who underwent baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT. In total, 1,603 lesions (1,302 lymph nodes, 117 spleen/liver, 150 bone, and 34 bone/soft-tissue) were semi-automatically segmented and grouped by volume (<3, 3-10, 10-30, >30 mL) and tissue type. 93 radiomic features were extracted from non-PVC and PVC images processed with the Richardson-Lucy (RL) and Reblurred Van Cittert (RVC) algorithms following IBSI guidelines. Reproducibility was quantified using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2, absolute agreement), with statistical comparisons performed via Mann-Whitney U tests and false-discovery-rate (FDR) correction. PVC significantly improved feature reproducibility, particularly for large lesions (>30 mL), with median ICC2>0.90 across most feature categories. Small lesions (<3 mL) showed lower stability (ICC2=0.84-0.94) and higher CoV (0.09-0.21). First-Order and GLCM features were the most robust overall (ICC2=0.92-0.99; CoV=0.07-0.11). Bone and spleen lesions exhibited the highest reproducibility (median ICC2 approx 0.95), whereas lymph-node and liver features were more variable. All volume- and tissue-dependent differences remained significant after FDR correction (p<0.05). PVC using RL and RVC markedly enhances FDG-PET radiomic reproducibility in lymphoma, particularly for larger and structurally uniform lesions. Robust features such as First-Order and GLCM can support standardized radiomics workflows and the development of reliable biomarkers for prognosis and personalized therapy.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise.

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\uff1a\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u8bfb\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u52a9\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u610f\u7684\u8fdd\u6cd5\u4fc3\u6210\u8005\u3002"}}

TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.

In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling.

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Feynman-Kac\uff08FK\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6216\u751f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6216\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6216\u751f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6216\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06FK\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u671d\u5411\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ProteinMPNN\u548c\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u677e\u5f1b\u7cbe\u70bc\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0cFK\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9776\u70b9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4FK\u63a7\u5236\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u670d\u88c5\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff08AAM\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u526a\u8f91\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9690\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1135%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction.

However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data.

This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance.

In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \\texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \\texttt{GPT} and \\texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \\texttt{Gemini} and \\texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience.

Imageto- image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement.

They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.\n  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBranching Flows\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u94fe\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u652f\u6811\u68ee\u6797\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u6811\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u5206\u652f\u548c\u6d88\u4ea1\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u652f\u548c\u6d88\u4ea1\u7387\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u7840\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "Branching Flows\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b"}}

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5173\u8054\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u3001DreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u6df9\u6ca1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u540e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0eGroup-DRO\u7b49SOTA\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5173\u952e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u5c42\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ef2\u88c1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a88.3\u5bf971.7\u3002\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

This approach inherits the local conservation property of finite volume methods while benefiting from the approximation capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin spaces with significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We establish a rigorous error analysis of the proposed scheme: in particular, we prove optimal-order convergence in the DG energy norm and suboptimal-order convergence in \\(L^2\\) norm. The theoretical analysis is supported by a set of one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, which confirm both the accuracy and efficiency of the method.

Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria.

While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(VAE)\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u808c\u8089\u5171\u6536\u7f29\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VAE\u5c06EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0a\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea630%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Bernges", "Florian Scholten"], "title": "Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets", "comment": null, "summary": "As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation.

In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \u03c3Z$, where $\u03c3\\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\u03c3^4)$ and $O(\u03c3^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.\n  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \\[ \\mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \u03c3^2 \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \\[ \\mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] \\[ \\mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y) - \\frac{\u03c3^4}{8} \\nabla \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\nabla \\log q(y) \\|^2 + \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\log q(y) \\right) . \\]", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u77e5\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u53ea\u77e5\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5728\u6062\u590d\u6574\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u7f29\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53bb\u566a\u5668T1\u548cT2\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u903c\u8fd1Monge-Amp\u00e8re\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5728\u5339\u914d\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86O(\u03c3^4)\u548cO(\u03c3^6)\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u6709\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u66f4\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs).

This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs.

The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis.

To enable analytical tractability, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the Kronecker product of two Hermitian Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the delay and Doppler domains. By invoking the Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2dOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4fe1\u9053\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u57df\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u7684\u514b\u7f57\u5185\u514b\u79ef\uff0c\u5229\u7528Szeg\u00f6\u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faLMMSE\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u89e3\u6790\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0cOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728LMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4fe1\u9053\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u57df\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u7684\u514b\u7f57\u5185\u514b\u79ef\uff0c\u5229\u7528Szeg\u00f6\u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e9\u9635\u53ef\u7531DFT\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0LMMSE\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faLMMSE\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u89e3\u6790\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u683c\u70b9\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3aOFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages.

To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDT-NVS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u76f8\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u76f8\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6446\u8131\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDT-NVS 3D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86transformer\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u62103D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DT-NVS\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u53d7\u9650\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784(\u5982\u98de\u673a\u7684\u5de6\u53f3\u673a\u7ffc)\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9(\u9634\u5f71)\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u5c06SiPF\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9634\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5LyapInf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u671f\u671b\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbeLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4e0e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "LyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b6264.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3aADS\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u9884\u9632\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u6536\u655b\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u6574\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u9ad8\u9636TV\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5229\u7528ADMM\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9-\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u534a\u6536\u655b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u4e00\u9636TV\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u9636\u68af\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636TV\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f46\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8c03\u548c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ade\u4e89\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u6536\u655b\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728ADMM\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u987a\u5e8f\u6574\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u9ad8\u9636TV\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u6d4b\u534a\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u8fed\u4ee3\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9-\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e8f\u5217\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u9636\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u3001\u6df7\u5408TV\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e58\u548c\uff08DMAS\uff09\u6280\u672f\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u56e0\u5b50\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u6c14\u58f0\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6c42\u548c\uff08DAS\uff09\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65c1\u74e3\u3001\u5bbd\u4e3b\u74e3\u548c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5355\u5feb\u7167\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\u53c8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e58\u548c\uff08DMAS\uff09\u6280\u672f\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u56e0\u5b50\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d85\u58f0\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u9635\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7GPU\u52a0\u901f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u58f0\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0eDAS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7a7a\u6c14\u58f0\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6210\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Webb", "Geoffrey Mackellar"], "title": "EEG-X: Device-Agnostic and Noise-Robust Foundation Model for EEG", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements!

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining.

However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff082D-PASS\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u8f90\u5c04\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5e73\u9762\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u76842D-PASS\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u5f62PASS\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$.

Our objective is to resolve the computational challenges associated with triple integration by transforming it into an initial value problem. Euler's method is the fundamental numerical technique for approximating the solution, thereby establishing a baseline for accuracy. The precision of our computations is subsequently improved by employing Richardson's extrapolation to reduce errors systematically. This approach not only illustrates the adaptability of numerical methods in solving intricate mathematical problems, but it also emphasizes the significance of strategic error reduction techniques in enhancing computational outcomes.

In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6PAD-D\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u5750\u6807\u57df\u8054\u5408\u7f13\u89e3\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u5e73\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f4d\u5931\u771f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u635f\u4f24\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u5931\u771f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6b8b\u4f59\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u5750\u6807\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5e45\u5ea6\u5931\u771f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668(PAD-D)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PAD-D\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668(EUC-D)\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668(GAP-D)\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636QAM\u548cSAPSK\u661f\u5ea7\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5e73\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "PAD-D\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u635f\u4f24\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6790SEP\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdNLP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u8ff0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f53\u9a8c\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u53d9\u8ff0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6b64\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eBio_ClinicalBERT\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f7f\u7528QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684GPT-4o mini\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u5fae\u89c2\u5e73\u57470.74\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u57470.59\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7c7b\u522b\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1bBio_ClinicalBERT\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9bNLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7eb5\u5411\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u6b63\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

A coupled-dipole model is presented that captures the array's mutual coupling due to both waveguide and free-space interactions, and a novel passivity constraint on the corresponding magnetic polarizabilities is proposed. Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u7ad9\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u91c7\u75282D\u6ce2\u5bfc\u9988\u7535\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u5b54\u5f84\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e92\u8026\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u78c1\u6781\u5316\u7387\u7684\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Neumann\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684Cramer-Rao\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5171\u632f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u5b54\u5f84\u7684\u53cc\u7ad9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u9635\u5217\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u78c1\u6781\u5316\u7387\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5229\u7528Neumann\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9635\u5217\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcCramer-Rao\u754c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5171\u632f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u8fd1\u573a\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u8d85\u8868\u9762XL MIMO\u53cc\u7ad9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u53cc\u7ad9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\\% labels on PubLayNet.

This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures.

With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684AI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5224\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u5e76\u4ecb\u5165\u6240\u9700\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd0\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression.

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "OUGS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e38\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8ff0\u6765\u6539\u8fdb3DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\u53c2\u6570\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a3DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining.

However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training).

Published in MDPI Journal of Imaging. Includes 1 supplementary video file (ancillary file)", "summary": "While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%).

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u5f62\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u91cd\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7535\u538b\u7535\u6d41\u4fe1\u53f7\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u56fa\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u8d28\u91cf\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807\u5931\u771f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9ec4\u91d1\u5206\u5272\u641c\u7d22\u786e\u5b9a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7b5b\u9009\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u641c\u7d22\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684VCS\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6MMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5931\u771f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\"\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\"\u8f6c\u5411\"\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b\"\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u627f\u8bfa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u51c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1a\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6d3b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u642d\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u671f\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3token\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4f7f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u66f4\u96be\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

We show that spectral predictability~$\u03a9$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\u03a9$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\u03a9$ drops. Computing $\u03a9$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $\u03a9$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$\u03a9$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u03a9\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5168\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u9009\u62e9\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u03a9\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GIFT-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u768451\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c28\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u03a9\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u03a9\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u03a9\u4ec5\u9700\u6bcf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03a9\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e2\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53c8\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u56f0\u96be(\u4f4e\u03a9)\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM).

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4e24\u8f6e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4f20\u7edfVARIERR\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5408\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6bd4\u79fb\u9664\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6269\u5c55\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework.

A novel LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism is developed, allowing context-aware and environment-adaptive probing for PASS to reduce overheads. Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams. Based on pretrained Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), the LLM is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) For single-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS attains over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and achieves 51.92% improvements in beamforming gains compared to conventional method. ii) For multi-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS framework significantly outperforms both the LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training, achieving up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5939\u634f\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u7528\u6237\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u5939\u634f\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5355\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u7801\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) \u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8eMMSE\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7801\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GPT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u5355\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cTop-1\u6ce2\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u589e\u76ca\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad851.92%\uff1b2) \u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u901f\u7387\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u548c\u4f20\u7edfPASS\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad857.14%\u548c33.33%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLM-enabled PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5355\u7528\u6237\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u6ce2\u675f\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e862025\u5e74\u4e09\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DeepSeek R1\u3001Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001GPT-5\uff09\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-5\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eLAMA\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u5212\u7ade\u8d5b\u5b66\u4e60\u8d5b\u9053\u4e2d\u7684PDDL\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u4ecePDDL\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "GPT-5\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eLAMA\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u6240\u6709LLM\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u964d\u5e45\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u957f\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df328\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u60c5\u5883\u548c1152\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u60c5\u5883\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Considering that multiple ports among the M available FA ports can be activated, the receiver selects the best K with the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and combines the received signals at the selected ports using maximum ratio combining. The statistics of the post-combining SNR are derived using a Laplace transform-based approach, which allows to analyze the outage probability (OP) of the FAS. Additional closed-form expressions for a lower bound on the OP and the asymptotic OP at high SNR are presented.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIVO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6311\u6218\u7684AntMaze\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u4f18\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM.

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AuthSig\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u7b7e\u540d\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u7b7e\u540d\u6613\u88ab\u590d\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65e0\u7eb8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u58a8\u6c34\u7b7e\u540d\u8f6c\u5411\u7535\u5b50\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u867d\u7136\u65b9\u4fbf\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u590d\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6c34\u5370\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u4e00\u6b21\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\"\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aAuthSig\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u5931\u771f\u548c\u7b7e\u540d\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798%\uff0c\u5728\u6253\u5370\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "AuthSig\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u9632\u590d\u5236\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7406AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u7406\u6784\u6210\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6301\u7eed\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7269\u7406AI\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u9879\u539f\u7406\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u662f\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u800c\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u5230\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features.

In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfVAE\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06FID\u964d\u4f4e\u4e865%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.7%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684SOTA\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6539\u8fdb\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u7b49\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06FID\uff08\u5f17\u96f7\u6b47\u8d77\u59cb\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e865%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.7%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6b63\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728FID\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u9879\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7Gamma\u5206\u5e03\u4e58\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TV\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ICTM\u548cRMSAV\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e25\u91cd\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728ICTM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542bI-\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TV\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7070\u5ea6\u7ea7\u6307\u793a\u5668\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RMSAV\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens).

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u8f86\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u6570\u636e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA Jetsons\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aFLAD\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f66\u8f86\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAD\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u5176\u5b50\u8bcd\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08isi-Xhosa\u3001Setswana\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u8bcd\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684isi-Xhosa\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u8bcd\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5411\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchor\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f53\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u524d\u63d0\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Anchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5230rollouts\u4e2d\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534a\u6570\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u6765\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff09\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002Anchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification.

Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u4f55\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF/DPO\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively.

We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "DBINDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5e8f\u5217\u5f62\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5f02\u5e8f\u5217(INDS)\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u641c\u7d22\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LightGBM\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenVidBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDBINDS\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DBINDS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53d6\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDermEval\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u5224\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4e2a\u6848\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9bRBF\u548cMat\u00e9rn\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u907f\u514d\u5206\u6790\u677e\u5f1b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMaPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\uff08\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u540d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u6b20\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08AMaPO\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Z\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u52aa\u529b\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u540d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u540d\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5b83\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque.

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFDT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u7f1d\u5408\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7f1d\u5408\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001RTG\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4RTG\u6807\u8bb0\u5931\u53bb\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdDT\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "DFDT\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff08MMD\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7528\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cOT\u504f\u5dee\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u66ff\u6362RTG\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u7684\u503c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\uff0cDFDT\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bb0\u7f1d\u5408\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u7f1d\u5408\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u968f\u7740MMD\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548cOT\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u754c\u9650\u4f1a\u6536\u7d27\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity.

Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751f\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5728\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cd\u9988\u5f52\u56e0\u5668\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u5e94\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6559\u5e08\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u8bef\u518d\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FQ-PETR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9PETR\u7cfb\u52173D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c75%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePETR\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684LiDAR\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u7ebf\u6027\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728softmax\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u6267\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08PETR\u3001StreamPETR\u3001PETRv2\u3001MV2d\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cFQ-PETR\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches generally follow an \"align-then-classify\" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\\texttt{$\\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\\textbf{F}$lexib$\\textbf{L}$e neighb$\\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions.

Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets.

Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784ViT\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNNs\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743 - \u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f - \u5b66\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Zelek"], "title": "DreamPose3D: Hallucinative Diffusion with Prompt Learning for 3D Human Pose Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism.

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution.

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u3002WOODELF\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u80cc\u666fShapley\u503c\u4ec5\u9700162\u79d2\uff0cGPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970016\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "CallosumNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5220\u9664\u5355\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eGDPR\u548cCCPA\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCallosumNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u865a\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCallosumNet\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1%-2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9MAE\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CallosumNet\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u9ec4\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPTE\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PTE\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6267\u884c\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u4e3b\u52a8\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u5e94\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPTE\u5728CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "comment": "6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words", "summary": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec244\u4e2a\u8d85\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5fc3S1\u9608\u503c\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u592a\u9633\u5468\u671f22\u300123\u548c24\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks.

A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenePheno\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8868\u578b\u5173\u8054\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u8868\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u8868\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u8868\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGenePheno\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3Fmax\u548c\u8868\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3AUC\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "GenePheno\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4e3a\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
