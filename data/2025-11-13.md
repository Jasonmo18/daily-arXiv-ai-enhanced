Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，通过三种互补的测试设置和衍生指标来建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时修改嘴唇运动，但存在嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，这难以通过标准指标检测。

Method: 提出了包含静默输入生成、不匹配音视频配对和匹配音视频合成的三种测试设置，并引入了唇同步差异和基于静默音频的唇同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供了见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有模型无关性，为未来说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中的行人跟踪问题，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测和跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态相机位置和复杂遮挡场景下表现不佳，需要更全面的数据集和框架来应对多无人机监控的独特挑战。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视角特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%轨迹，迁移学习和相机故障实验显示良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，在复杂环境下显著优于静态相机方法。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了端到端自动驾驶需要详尽场景建模的传统假设，提出基于信念-意图协同进化的认知规划方法，在nuPlan基准测试中实现了高性能且无需未来预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，作者认为有效的规划源于信念和意图在语义丰富令牌中的协同进化，而非对世界的详尽重建，旨在建立更智能的规划范式。

Method: 提出基于令牌的信念-意图协同进化方法，使用稀疏意图令牌进行轨迹解码，并通过预测未来令牌来提升性能，避免显式重建损失。

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中，仅使用稀疏意图令牌达到0.487m ADE，结合未来令牌预测后降至0.382m（提升21.6%），并观察到认知一致性和时间模糊性的自发涌现。

Conclusion: 智能不在于像素保真度，而在于信念与意图的令牌化二元性，通过重新定义规划为理解而非反应，为具有前瞻性的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

### [5] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库替代任务特定的子内存库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在推理阶段使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性的问题。

Method: 提出统一内存库框架，所有任务共享一个内存库，在训练期间通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在推理阶段使用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实世界电子纸数据集上实现100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上优于现有基线，证明了其在实践场景中的鲁棒性，并将开源实现。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一框架，结合扩散去噪与时间感知的actor-critic模型，解决自动驾驶事故预测中的传感器噪声和及时可靠预警问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对主动安全驾驶至关重要，但面临传感器输入噪声和及时可靠预警的挑战。

Method: 使用扩散模块重建抗噪声的图像和物体特征，结合actor-critic架构进行长时域时间推理和时间加权奖励，确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上达到最先进精度，显著提高平均事故前时间，在噪声条件下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定、与人一致的预测，具有现实世界安全关键部署潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [7] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持通用任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型提取的时空特征会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型，不适合视频基础模型。

Method: 引入轻量级匿名适配器模块（AAM），采用三种新设计的训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 评估显示隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时在动作识别、时序动作检测和异常检测等下游任务中保持接近基线的效用性能，还能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种有效的隐私保护解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时维持模型性能，并促进更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现在固定32×32分辨率下，图像分类和生成的优化缩放策略存在差异，生成任务需要数据量以比分类任务快3-5倍的速度增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据规模增长更快，计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但研究不足的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，为未来大规模视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 在32×32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，使用IsoFlops配置文件，计算预算达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fr'echet距离）。

Result: 1. 在固定分辨率下，图像分类和生成的优化缩放策略不同，生成任务需要数据量增长速度快3-5倍；2. 分辨率提高时，模型规模需比数据规模增长更快；3. 主要瓶颈是计算能力而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 计算能力是逐像素图像建模的主要限制因素，随着计算能力每年增长4-5倍，预计未来五年内可实现逐像素图像建模。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth）生成平衡的训练数据来解决图像分类中的群体偏见问题，通过聚类和分组训练提高数据生成质量，在多个基准测试中表现优于原始Stable Diffusion，与SOTA去偏技术相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统因训练数据中群体代表性不均而存在偏见，如人脸数据集中金发与女性的刻板关联。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布，需要更精确的生成技术。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA、DreamBooth），通过聚类每个群体内的图像并训练每个聚类的DreamBooth模型来防止模型被群体内变异淹没，生成群体平衡的预训练数据后在实际数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与Group-DRO等SOTA去偏技术结果相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度增加而超越这些技术。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成更准确的群体平衡训练数据，缓解图像分类中的偏见问题，在严重偏见情况下表现优于现有去偏方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Conclusion: DT-NVS在真实世界日常场景的新视角合成方面表现出色，超越了现有方法，为3D感知生成模型在复杂真实场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因受限感受野导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题，能够在保持旋转不变性的同时保留全局姿态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的旋转不变特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构(如飞机的左右机翼)。

Method: 1. 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点(阴影)，将局部旋转不变描述符与全局姿态信息相结合；2. 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3. 基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转来构建一致的阴影。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有旋转不变方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合局部旋转不变特征和全局姿态信息，有效解决了旋转不变学习中的翼尖特征崩溃问题，在保持旋转不变性的同时提升了空间区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于EfficientNet架构的四步深度学习方法来分类胶质母细胞瘤的6个组织病理学区域，在BraTS-Path 2024挑战数据集上进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后差，自动化识别其组织病理学亚区域有助于大规模形态学理解该疾病。

Method: 使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4变体）的四步深度学习分类方法，在BraTS-Path 2024数据集上进行5折交叉验证。

Result: EfficientNet-B1和B4在训练集上F1分数达0.98，但在验证集和测试集上分别降至0.546和0.517，显示模型泛化能力挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管训练性能优异，但模型在新数据上的泛化能力有限，这对临床应用至关重要，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合视觉预测与LLM结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过概率加权方法在轻量级和预训练模型上都实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管半监督学习有所进展，文档布局理解仍然需要大量数据。作者希望利用LLM的结构先验知识来增强半监督检测性能。

Method: 使用OCR-LLM流水线推断文档的层次区域，然后通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合，生成精炼的伪标签。

Result: 在PubLayNet数据集上，使用5%标签时：轻量级SwiftFormer达到88.2±0.3 AP；结合LayoutLMv3达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越了标准半监督学习和UDOP方法。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验对轻量级和预训练架构都具有互补性，能够提供语义消歧能力，且开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OUGS提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的主动重建框架，通过从高斯基元的物理参数推导不确定性，并结合语义分割实现对象感知的视图选择，显著提升了目标对象的重建效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性度量，这些度量常受无关背景干扰，导致对象中心任务中视图选择效率低下。需要一种更原则性的、物理基础的不确定性表述来改进3DGS重建。

Method: 从3D高斯基元的显式物理参数（位置、尺度、旋转）直接推导不确定性，通过渲染雅可比矩阵传播参数协方差，建立可解释的不确定性模型，并集成语义分割掩码生成目标感知的不确定性分数。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验评估表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，相比现有最先进方法，对目标对象实现了更高质量的重建，同时作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象高效重建的挑战，为3DGS重建提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性限制，特别是针对训练数据中未包含的姿态，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现可靠的人员检测。

Method: 利用服装的光谱反射特性，在无GPU的边缘设备上实现轻量级、形状无关的人员检测系统HitoMi-Cam。

Result: 处理速度达23.2 fps（253x190像素），在搜救场景中平均精度93.5%，远超CNN模型的最佳精度53.8%，误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在形状不可预测的真实环境（如灾难救援）中，边缘设备上实时操作的可行补充工具。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Motivation: 纯文本训练虽然能解决零样本图像描述中的数据稀缺问题，但在跨域泛化时会产生大量幻觉内容。检索方法虽然试图缓解这一问题，但可能因检索到不相关实体而加剧幻觉。

Method: 提出负实体抑制(NES)方法，包含三个步骤：使用合成图像确保训练和推理时图像到文本检索的一致性；过滤检索内容中的负实体；使用识别的负实体进行注意力级抑制以减少幻觉倾向特征的影响。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NES在保持域内竞争性能的同时，显著提升了跨域迁移能力并降低了幻觉率，在零样本图像描述任务中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的跨域泛化和幻觉问题，为纯文本训练的图像描述系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

TL;DR: SPEED-Q是一个针对视觉语言模型(VLMs)的低比特权重量化框架，专门解决边缘设备部署中的量化敏感性和训练稳定性问题，在2比特设置下比现有方法准确率提升高达6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署视觉语言模型(VLMs)对于实现低延迟和隐私保护的智能应用至关重要。由于这些设备的资源限制，量化提供了一种有前景的解决方案，但现有研究很少探索对VLMs进行激进量化，特别是适合资源受限边缘设备的1B到2B参数模型。

Conclusion: SPEED-Q能够实现复杂VLMs的准确、稳定和数据高效的量化，为边缘设备上的视觉语言模型部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Motivation: 现有的人机协同压缩方法主要基于人类视觉压缩流程，在整合机器视觉压缩时存在复杂度和比特率方面的不足。机器视觉仅关注图像/视频中的核心区域，所需信息远少于人类视觉压缩信息。

Method: 提出基于机器视觉导向压缩的新型协同压缩方法Diff-FCHM，采用即插即用可变比特率策略，渐进聚合机器视觉压缩的语义信息，并利用扩散先验无缝恢复人类视觉的高保真细节。

Conclusion: Diff-FCHM成功实现了基于机器视觉压缩的人机协同压缩框架，为同时服务于人类感知和机器智能的图像/视频数据压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟是实时应用的关键障碍。现有的轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在根本性权衡：轨迹蒸馏能保持全局结构但牺牲高频细节，分布蒸馏能实现更高保真度但易出现模式崩溃和不稳定训练。

Method: 提出分层蒸馏（HD）框架：1）使用轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"作为初始化；2）用分布蒸馏进行细化；3）引入自适应加权判别器（AWD）动态分配token权重，专注于局部缺陷实现高效细节优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了一个强大的新范式，通过协同使用轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏，结合专门设计的判别器结构，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BRHVC的双向参考协调视频压缩方法，通过双向运动汇聚和双向上下文融合技术优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩（NBVC）相对于P帧压缩研究不足，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次上，使得两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动汇聚（BMC）和双向上下文融合（BCF）。BMC在运动压缩中汇聚多个光流，实现更大尺度上更精确的运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，显著提升压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGMs)在生成高质量图像方面很有效，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。为了解决这个问题，需要一种方法来增强生成输出的多样性。

Method: 1. 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2. 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动调度策略来渐进优化超参数；3. 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGMs实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了可比的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是第一个将HD引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Conclusion: AuthSig框架成功解决了静态电子签名的安全认证问题，通过水印技术实现了可靠的签名验证和防复制保护。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效处理噪声污染和强度不均匀性图像的分割问题，在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个新颖的开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负视觉提示来抑制视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物，解决了现有方法仅依赖正提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时表现脆弱。需要引入负提示来提升模型的区分能力。

Method: 提出了统一的视觉提示编码器联合处理正负视觉提示；设计了无需训练的动态负响应抑制模块(NNC)；开发了负提示铰链损失(NNH)来增强正负嵌入的区分度；支持灵活的正负推理模式。

Result: 在零样本检测任务中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景下表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上达到51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni框架通过有效利用负视觉提示显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Owl是一个基于因果关系的框架，通过建模视觉和文本注意力的交互来缓解大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。它提出了VTACR指标来量化模态贡献不平衡，并通过细粒度注意力干预机制和双路径对比解码策略显著减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用。为了解决物体幻觉问题，需要建模幻觉过程的因果机制。

Method: 提出Owl框架：1) 通过结构因果图建模幻觉过程，将分解的视觉和文本注意力作为中介；2) 引入VTACR指标量化解码过程中的模态贡献不平衡；3) 设计细粒度注意力干预机制，根据VTACR信号动态调整token和layer级注意力；4) 提出双路径对比解码策略，一条路径强调视觉基础预测，另一条放大幻觉预测。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试上的实验结果表明，Owl实现了显著的幻觉减少，在保持忠实度的同时设立了新的SOTA，同时保留了视觉语言理解能力。

Conclusion: Owl通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解了物体幻觉问题，证明了建模视觉和文本注意力交互的重要性，为LVLMs的幻觉缓解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: 所提出的组合增量学习框架能够有效提升模型在持续学习新组合时的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji文档处理中噪声挑战的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和基线方法。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于从皮肤病图像直接生成诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床负责任部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建了DermBench基准数据集（包含4000张真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述），并使用基于LLM的评判器对候选叙述进行评分；同时训练了DermEval无参考多模态评估器，能够对图像和生成叙述进行结构化批判和评分。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了它们的可靠性。

Method: TACO将响应分解为原子查询，通过转述减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型优化答案。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在减轻幻觉问题方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽略了跨模态表示的潜力。本文探索使用CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为知识蒸馏的补充监督源。

Method: 提出RichKD框架，融合传统教师模型的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，生成更丰富、语义更强的监督信号。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有基线，产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RichKD通过融合视觉-语言知识有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，证明了跨模态表示在知识蒸馏中的重要性，为多教师知识蒸馏提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

*Jiangyong Yu,Changyong Shu,Sifan Zhou,Zichen Yu,Xing Hu,Yan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，通过量化友好的位置嵌入、双查找表和非线性算子优化，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降）和75%延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但面临高计算成本和内存占用的部署挑战。现有量化方法直接应用于PETR会导致严重精度下降，主要由于多模态特征幅度差异和非线性算子量化困难。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）量化友好的LiDAR射线位置嵌入，用单点采样替代多点采样；2）双查找表算法，用两个级联线性查找表近似复杂非线性函数；3）数值稳定化后量化，在softmax数值稳定化后执行量化以减少注意力失真。

Result: 在PETR系列模型（PETR、StreamPETR、PETRv2、MV2d）上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时减少延迟高达75%，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化部署的挑战，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升推理效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flora的零样本骨架动作识别方法，通过灵活的邻居感知语义调整和开放形式分布感知流分类器，解决了现有方法中脆弱的点对点对齐和刚性分类器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本骨架动作识别方法存在两个基本问题：(i) 由于不完美的语义导致的脆弱点对点对齐，(ii) 受限于静态决策边界和粗粒度锚点的刚性分类器。

Method: Flora方法包含两个核心组件：1) 灵活的邻居感知语义调整，通过整合相邻类间上下文线索形成方向感知的区域语义，结合跨模态几何一致性目标确保稳定的点对区域对齐；2) 开放形式分布感知流分类器，使用无噪声流匹配来弥合语义和骨架潜在嵌入之间的模态分布差距，同时通过条件无关对比正则化增强可区分性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，即使在仅使用10%的可见数据训练时也表现出特别令人印象深刻的性能。

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和分布感知分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，在多个数据集上取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的支气管镜导航框架，通过2D-3D配准实现内窥镜视图与术前CT的实时对齐，并创建了首个公开的合成基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决支气管镜术中定位的挑战，包括呼吸运动、解剖变异和CT与身体差异导致的变形和错位问题，现有方法在跨域和跨患者泛化方面存在不足。

Method: 使用微调的模态和域不变编码器直接计算真实内窥镜RGB帧与CT渲染深度图之间的相似性，通过可微分渲染模块迭代优化相机位姿，基于深度一致性进行配准。

Result: 在合成基准数据集上，仅使用合成数据训练，模型达到平均平移误差2.65毫米和旋转误差0.19弧度，在真实患者数据上表现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒、域不变的定位，新基准数据集为基于视觉的支气管镜导航标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Motivation: 现有MOT方法主要针对日常场景或特定运动（如足球、篮球），而美式足球因频繁遮挡和身体接触等挑战缺乏标准化数据集，难以公平比较不同方法。

Method: 构建首个美式足球运动员专用检测与跟踪数据集，对多种检测和跟踪方法进行比较评估，包括微调检测模型和集成重识别模型到跟踪系统中。

Result: 微调检测模型比预训练模型性能更好；将微调检测器和重识别模型集成到跟踪系统中，相比现有方法显著提高了跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这项工作能够在传统方法难以应对的挑战性高密度场景中，实现美式足球运动员的鲁棒检测与跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双教师知识蒸馏框架，利用异构ViT教师和同构CNN教师协同指导轻量级CNN学生，通过差异感知教师加权和结构差异感知蒸馏策略，解决架构不匹配问题并提升蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在视频动作识别中表现优异但计算成本高，轻量级CNNs效率高但精度不足。现有的跨架构知识蒸馏方法存在架构不匹配问题，且忽视了同构CNN教师的价值。

Method: 双教师知识蒸馏框架：1）差异感知教师加权 - 基于教师置信度和与学生预测差异动态融合ViT和CNN教师的预测；2）结构差异感知蒸馏 - 学生通过轻量级辅助分支学习ViT和CNN教师间的残差特征，专注于可转移的架构差异。

Result: 在HMDB51、EPIC-KITCHENS-100和Kinetics-400等基准测试中，该方法持续优于最先进的蒸馏方法，在HMDB51上最高获得5.95%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 双教师知识蒸馏框架有效解决了架构不匹配问题，通过协同利用异构和同构教师的优势，显著提升了轻量级CNN学生的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

TL;DR: DreamPose3D是一个基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过动作感知推理和时间想象来解决模糊运动问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每帧姿态，无法有效解决模糊运动和泛化到真实场景的问题。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合动作感知推理和时间想象力。

Method: 提出DreamPose3D扩散框架：1）使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2）引入表示编码器，将运动学关节亲和度融入注意力机制；3）幻觉姿态解码器在训练中预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP数据集上的广泛实验表明，在所有指标上都达到了最先进的性能。在广播棒球数据集上的测试进一步验证了其鲁棒性，即使面对模糊和噪声的2D输入也能有效处理时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理和时间想象，成功解决了3D人体姿态估计中的模糊运动问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出色，并展示了在真实场景中的强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异质图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过建模用户-LLM-查询-响应的复杂交互关系，在少样本数据下有效捕捉用户偏好，实现个性化模型路由选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏充分个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、噪声大、格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互建模为包含用户、LLM、查询、响应四种节点类型的异质图，通过定制化的消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线方法，准确率提高0.9%至21.6%，AUC提高0.006至0.309。更重要的是，仅需少量数据即可适应新用户和动态变化的偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异质图建模有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下表现出色，能够适应新用户和动态偏好，为个性化LLM路由提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能够真实地模拟在线社区和社交媒体上的对话，这对于测试内容推荐算法设计和评估内容政策效果具有重要意义，但目前这种模拟的有效性尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实的人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o两个LLM在相同主题上生成人工对话，然后将真实对话和AI生成对话并排呈现给研究参与者进行识别。

Result: LLM生成的对话有39%的概率被误认为是人类创建的，其中Llama 3生成的对话仅有56%被正确识别为AI生成，仅略高于随机概率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，这既显示了LLMs在社会模拟方面的巨大潜力，也警示了其可能被滥用于生成不真实的社交媒体内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

Conclusion: 通过结合增强的安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以开发出能够在敏感法律领域提供道德和安全协助的LLMs，确保它们成为法律的保护者而非无意的违法促成者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能够有效提升LLM输出多样性同时保持对齐性能。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文档生成功能，通过交互式聊天界面提供法律草案、引用和平白语言解释。

Result: 在2022和2023年孟加拉国律师委员会考试的所有阶段评估中，Mina在初步多选题、笔试和模拟口试中得分75-80%，匹配或超过人类平均表现。

Conclusion: Mina展示了作为低成本多语言AI助手的潜力，能够自动化关键法律任务并扩大司法可及性，为构建特定领域、低资源系统提供了现实案例研究。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架来测试LLMs在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度，通过让LLM生成并验证真假陈述，然后测试其对自身生成的假信息的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍了LLMs在高风险领域的实际部署，需要测试其在对抗性提示下的真实性保真度。

Method: 三步骤框架：1) LLM生成特定领域内的真假陈述；2) LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对自身生成的假信息的抵抗力。

Result: 评估了5个主流LLM，发现Claude抗性最强，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek最弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLMs进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，需要提高LLMs对对抗性提示的抵抗力。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [54] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用模型自身生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，成功绕过LLM的安全防护机制，在零样本和少样本条件下分别达到最高33%和41%的越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性，需要研究LLM安全防护的根本性重新设计。

Method: 使用同一模型生成的缓解有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo等三个模型上进行实验，采用基于前缀的自动评估和人工评估相结合的方法。

Result: 零样本条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率，少样本条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率，自动评估平均高估52%的越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 自动评估单独使用不足以准确判断有害性，需要建立更稳健的评估方法，并从根本上重新考虑防护栏设计。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个结合检索增强生成(RAG)和专业知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例材料，解决了传统手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉并需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识和工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源大语言模型，设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证展示了RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例的技术可行性。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案达到了可接受的性能，表明隐私保护机构部署的潜力。

Conclusion: 整合精选知识库能够生成符合专业指南的内容。在教育和研究实施前需要专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估。未来应用可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思培训。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DisCoCirc形式主义到孟加拉语，评估其在英孟翻译中的有效性，重新检验该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的能力。

Method: 将DisCoCirc框架从英语扩展到孟加拉语，应用于英孟翻译任务，分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的表现。

Result: 发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异而面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc在翻译中存在约束，与先前声称的效果存在分歧，表明该框架需要进一步改进，特别是在处理语言结构差异方面。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Motivation: 医疗决策支持系统对急诊医生快速准确评估患者状况至关重要，大语言模型在医疗决策支持中具有应用潜力，需要评估其在急诊医学诊断中的实际表现。

Method: 构建MEDAS超级学习器，集成Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT和Claude五种大语言模型，使用元学习器学习各模型的不同能力，通过集体能力提升诊断准确性。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率为58%-65%，超过人类医生；超级学习器集成后准确率达70%，其中至少一个模型单独诊断准确率达85%。

Conclusion: 元学习方法整合的LLM集群诊断准确率超过任何单个模型，表明超级学习器能够利用所有LLM训练医疗数据集的集体知识优势。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度感知的自适应数据选择方法GrADS，用于LLMs的监督微调，仅需5%-50%的数据就能超越全数据微调效果，同时显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在领域专业化过程中资源消耗大且容易导致灾难性遗忘，需要一种更高效的数据选择方法。

Method: 通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度，设计基于梯度幅值和统计分布的自引导标准，优先选择对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域的实验表明，仅使用5%的GrADS选择数据就能超越全数据微调，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法在LLMs领域专业化微调中具有显著效率和成本效益，能够用更少数据获得更好性能并缓解遗忘问题。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者在日常生活中的认知体验描述可以提供疾病相关认知和情绪变化的重要见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。

Result: 微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微观平均0.74，宏观平均0.59），在上下文相关类别如思维和社交互动中表现优异；Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的认知功能纵向监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作任务中需要适应用户个人偏好，但现有训练数据集往往将不同个人品味视为整体，缺乏个性化建模能力。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，收集60人的阅读习惯自述和100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好变化。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在显著差异；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术发展奠定了基础，展示了通过实际偏好数据训练模型的有效性，而自述偏好信息在预测实际偏好方面作用有限。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响事实可靠性，需要解决这一挑战来增强LLM输出的可信度。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修正三个阶段，使用最小化任务路由提示实现跨领域的零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在五个代表性任务（问答、对话、摘要、数学应用题和矛盾检测）上的实验结果表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean框架有潜力在现实应用中增强LLM输出的可信度，通过轻量级、任务无关的方式有效检测和修正幻觉内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型并行生成与自回归模型高质量之间的权衡问题，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高吞吐量和高GPU利用率。

Method: 设计结构化注意力掩码，在单个前向传递中同时进行扩散草稿生成和自回归采样，充分利用GPU计算密度。

Result: TiDAR在1.5B和8B规模上评估，吞吐量比自回归模型高4.71-5.91倍，质量和效率均优于推测解码和扩散变体。

Conclusion: TiDAR是首个在保持自回归模型质量的同时显著提高吞吐量的架构，实现了并行草稿和采样的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

*Longfei Zuo,Barbara Plank,Siyao Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EVADE框架，利用大型语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的错误标注，相比传统的人工两轮标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，存在人类标注变异性问题，难以区分标注错误和合理的标注差异。传统VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高昂且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大型语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误。通过比较人类和LLM检测到的错误，分析分布比较、验证重叠以及对模型微调的影响。

Result: 实验表明，LLM验证能够优化生成的解释分布，使其更接近人类标注。从训练数据中移除LLM检测到的错误比移除人工标注者识别的错误更能提升微调性能。

Conclusion: LLM验证有潜力扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异情况下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

TL;DR: SpiralThinker是一个统一的潜在推理框架，通过迭代更新潜在表示实现扩展的隐式推理，无需生成额外标记。结合渐进对齐目标和结构化注释，在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，以及系统性地交织隐式和显式推理的方式。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，在潜在表示上执行迭代更新，结合渐进对齐目标和结构化注释来维持潜在与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在潜在推理方法中取得了最佳整体性能，在所有基准测试中始终超越先前方法。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短对话和静态评估，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要开发更贴近真实场景的评估方法。

Method: 采用用户中心视角，构建大规模情感情境和干扰事件数据集，约束模型使用经过验证的情绪调节策略，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计方法。

Result: 通过对多种大语言模型的广泛评估，发现了情感支持能力存在显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹评估框架能够更全面地评估大语言模型的长期情感支持性能，揭示了不同模型在情感支持能力上的差异，为未来模型优化提供了指导。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLM在金融、医疗等受监管行业中因随机性限制而难以应用的问题，确保在严格政策下的逻辑正确性。

Result: 基准测试显示该方法超过99%的可靠性，表明在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够支持验证结果并用于改进原始文本，为受监管行业提供可靠的LLM应用方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Result: 在测试集上达到6.23%的词错误率，相比固定分块基线相对提升48.15%，同时显著降低识别延迟并保持接近全局解码的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了安多藏语流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，显著提升了识别准确率和效率，同时适应了藏语的语言学特征。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在复杂多步推理场景中效果有限，且大多依赖结果监督，缺乏对中间步骤的明确指导，导致奖励攻击和响应质量下降。

Method: 提出Bi-RAR框架，基于Kolmogorov复杂度引入双向信息距离来评估每个中间步骤的信息完整性，并采用多目标强化学习框架和级联奖励结构来优化推理。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试上的实证结果表明，Bi-RAR超越了先前的方法，并在训练和推理过程中实现了与搜索引擎的高效交互和推理。

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估和多目标强化学习有效提升了检索增强推理的性能，特别是在复杂多步推理场景中。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: DoPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过检测特征图中的异常频率带并重新参数化为高斯分布，有效改善Transformer模型在长序列上的外推能力，显著提升检索准确性和推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在Transformer模型中存在长度外推限制，注意力图存在异常频率带导致注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长上下文中的表现。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并使用无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和多样本上下文学习任务中，DoPE在长达64K token的扩展上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据进化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来改进工具学习。它通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：能力探测、标签验证和错误驱动数据扩展，在开源生态系统中显著提升了LLMs的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具学习受到静态合成数据管道的限制，数据生成和模型训练作为两个分离的非交互过程，无法自适应地关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：(1)贪婪能力探测诊断模型已掌握和失败的能力；(2)判断引导标签验证使用开源判断模型查找并纠正标注错误，逐步净化数据集；(3)错误驱动数据扩展基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，并在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往会产生错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算给定问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，然后选择最相关行和列交集的单元格作为答案。语言模型在问题-表头对的小数据集上使用对比学习进行训练。

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上评估，该流水线达到74.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o mini（63.9%）等现有LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法在表格问答中表现优于现有LLM，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提高性能并缩小与人类评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较不同版本的sequentiality度量与人类评估的一致性，并分析其与标准语言特征结合时的预测效果。

Result: 基于上下文的sequentiality版本与人类对组织和连贯性等话语层面特征的评估更一致；虽然零样本LLM预测更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征结合时比原始版本和仅主题版本增加更多预测价值，且优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动论文评分和相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本研究旨在探索如果语言模型能够动态优化分词，其子词在预训练和微调过程中如何演化。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型（SSLM）框架以支持预训练和微调，针对三种形态类型不同的语言（isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语）进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别出四个子词学习阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了改进文本生成和跨语言迁移的途径。

Conclusion: 可学习子词为低资源、形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移提供了有前景的方法，子词边界在微调过程中会向更细粒度方向调整。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中往往忽略了源语言之间的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差，特别是在高低资源语言之间存在性能差距。

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏置补偿模块粗粒度对齐初始语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3）采用层调度策略将OT约束集中在语义最有益的层上。

Conclusion: POTSA通过跨语言平行语音对和最优传输约束，有效弥合了高低资源语言之间的翻译性能差距，证明了该方法在提升多语言语音翻译性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C³TG是一个两阶段框架，用于细粒度、多维度的文本属性控制，通过选择性配对LLM与属性分类器，结合加权KL散度调整token概率，并在优化阶段使用能量函数解决属性冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，特别是在属性要求冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出C³TG两阶段框架：生成阶段选择性地将LLM与17个可用维度中的所需属性分类器配对，使用加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段利用结合分类器分数和惩罚项的能量函数，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低毒性。

Conclusion: C³TG是一种有效且灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案，无需昂贵的模型修改。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Result: 实验结果显示微调后的模型不仅能准确预测标签，还能提供推理过程，识别极性相关关键词来支持预测。

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并贡献了新的高棉语极性数据集，模型和数据集已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用固定删除率的方法在处理不同长度自然输入时表现不佳，导致认证鲁棒性不理想，需要开发能够动态调整删除率的适应性方法。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可调整的删除率机制，基于输入特性动态调整删除策略，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除场景。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得了显著的实证结果，认证区域的基数中位数相比最先进方法提升了高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率，有效提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性，为处理变长输入提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准测试无法有效区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的评估标准来测试模型的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,460个英语和印地语双语问题的多模态基准测试，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估17个最先进模型在JEE Advanced考试题目上的表现。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，而开源模型仅为37-45%；当增加元认知推理负荷时，GPT-5只能修复5.2%的错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准测试能够有效区分不同模型的训练和推理方法质量，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆效应。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展能提升大语言模型的推理性能，但计算成本高昂。现有动态自一致性方法虽然减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 整合系统1和系统2推理：利用快速系统1计算查询的答案熵，评估样本扩展潜力；系统2进行动态自一致性处理，实现并行生成。

Result: 与现有方法相比，令牌消耗减少高达47%，推理延迟降低43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架通过系统1和系统2的协同工作，在保持性能的同时显著提升了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher的转换解决方案存在局限性，需要依赖RDF图或外部工具。需要一种轻量级、不依赖本体的解析器来改进转换准确率。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法，灵感来自传统编程语言编译器，无需RDF图或外部工具支持。

Result: 在Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite实现了77.8%的总解析准确率，显著优于S2CTrans的44.2%。在执行准确率方面达到96.6%，比S2CTrans高出7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite在SPARQL到Cypher转换方面表现出色，显著提升了准确率。同时生成了Spider4SSC数据集，支持文本到多种查询语言的转换研究。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在评估输出方面越来越有效和可扩展，但尚不清楚这种能力是否能够扩展到更一般的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础LLM，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分保持一致。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估表明，所提出的模型性能得到了改进。进一步分析发现，这种增强的评估能力还能显著改善下游任务。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面表现出色，其增强的评估能力对下游任务也有积极影响。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Method: 通过在不同自然语言理解和推理任务上，比较不同规模和家族的语言模型在两种范式下的性能趋势和错误修正行为。

Conclusion: 自我修正机制的设计应考虑任务结构与输出空间的交互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排名的样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），而对错误排名的样本提供不足的纠正信号（欠拟合），这限制了排名准确性的进一步提升。

Method: 提出自适应边界偏好优化（AMaPO），采用实例级自适应边界，通过Z归一化和指数缩放进行精炼，动态重新分配学习努力：放大错误排名样本的梯度，抑制正确排名样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排名准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，而且针对性分析证实它成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

### [94] [Per-Lesion Radiomics Analysis of 68Ga-DOTA FAPI-46 and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08812)

TL;DR: 本研究比较了[68Ga]-DOTA FAPI-46和[18F]-FDG PET/CT在非小细胞肺癌中的放射组学特征，发现两种示踪剂在强度、纹理和形状特征上存在显著差异，提供了关于肿瘤内异质性和基质活性的互补信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超越传统SUV指标的肿瘤内异质性，通过比较两种PET示踪剂的放射组学特征来增强病灶表征和临床决策。

Method: 对28个PET/CT扫描（14个FDG和14个FAPI）中的81个共定位病灶进行分割，使用PyRadiomics提取放射组学特征，采用配对t检验或Wilcoxon符号秩检验进行统计分析。

Result: 在肺病灶中，FAPI显示较低的一阶指标但较高的方差和GLCM对比度；纵隔淋巴结差异较少；骨病灶显示广泛变异，包括FAPI熵值降低。特征重叠突出了基质（FAPI）和代谢（FDG）的互补见解。

Conclusion: 病灶级放射组学能够从FAPI和FDG PET中捕获互补的生物学信息，突显了传统SUV指标未能完全体现的肿瘤内异质性和基质活性。

Abstract: This pilot study compares per-lesion radiomics features of [68Ga]-DOTA FAPI-46 and [18F]-FDG PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to explore complementary insights into intratumoral heterogeneity beyond conventional SUV metrics, aiming to enhance lesion characterization and clinical decision-making. A total of 28 PET/CT scans (14 [18F]-FDG and 14 [68Ga]-DOTA FAPI-46) were acquired for the initial staging of biopsy-confirmed NSCLC. A total of 81 co-localized lesions (lung: 21, mediastinal lymph nodes: 42, bone: 18) were segmented, with radiomics features extracted via PyRadiomics after IBSI-compliant preprocessing. Paired per-lesion comparisons used t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Significant differences (adjusted P < 0.05) were identified across intensity, texture, and shape features. In lung lesions, FAPI showed lower first-order metrics but higher variance and GLCM contrast, suggesting stromal heterogeneity. Mediastinal lymph nodes had fewer differences, with FAPI exhibiting lower run percentage (GLRLM: -0.298, -6.196, P=1.45E-08). Bone lesions showed extensive variations, including reduced FAPI entropy (e.g., Entropy: -1.743, -5.798, P=6.95E-08). Feature overlaps highlighted complementary stromal (FAPI) and metabolic (FDG) insights. This pilot study demonstrates that per-lesion radiomics can capture complementary biological information from FAPI and FDG PET in NSCLC, highlighting intratumoral heterogeneity and stromal activity not fully appreciated by conventional SUV-based metrics.

TL;DR: 开发了一个图像引导的临床前平台，用于精确的超高剂量率（UHDR）和常规剂量率（CONV）照射，以研究FLASH放疗对大鼠脊髓的晚期毒性保护效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FLASH放疗在晚期反应器官中的持久性仍不确定，限制了其临床应用。脊髓因其临床重要性和陡峭的剂量-反应关系，是评估FLASH对晚期毒性影响的理想模型。

Method: 使用改良的直线加速器照射大鼠C1-T2脊髓，集成定制固定装置、便携X射线成像系统和电离室UHDR输出监测系统，开发蒙特卡罗剂量引擎进行精确剂量计算。

Result: 实现了亚毫米级的C1-T2定位精度和亚毫米级的分次内运动控制，电离室读数与UHDR输出呈线性相关，蒙特卡罗模拟显示沿中央约13mm脊髓的均匀照射，CONV和UHDR束流分布差异小于3%。

Conclusion: 建立了首个全面的图像引导临床前平台，为系统评估FLASH效应在晚期反应器官中的作用和确定FLASH的临床适用性奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Objective: While FLASH radiotherapy is recognized for short-term normal tissue sparing, its durability in late-responding organs remains uncertain, limiting clinical adoption. With its clinical importance and steep dose-response, the spinal cord is an ideal model for evaluating FLASH effect on late toxicity. This work introduces a robust image-guided research platform for high-precision irradiation at both CONV and UHDR to enable FLASH late toxicity studies using a rat spinal cord model. Approach: A modified LINAC was employed to irradiate the C1-T2 rat spinal cord with 18 MeV UHDR and CONV beams. A custom rat immobilization device, a portable X-ray imaging system, and an ion-chamber-based UHDR output monitoring system were integrated to ensure accurate C1-T2 localization and precise dose delivery. A Monte Carlo (MC) dose engine was developed to provide accurate dosimetry and support interpretation of in vivo results. Scintillator measurements were performed within the spinal cord to verify MC results and the precision of our platform. Results: We achieved submillimeter C1-T2 setup accuracy and maintained submillimeter intrafraction motion. Ion chamber readings showed linear correlation with UHDR output. MC indicated uniform irradiation along the central ~13 mm cord. Our CONV beam exhibited distribution close to that of the UHDR beam, with difference <3%, isolating dose rate as the only variable. Scintillator-measured dose agreed with MC within 4%, confirming both MC accuracy and the platform's high-precision delivery. Significance: We developed the first comprehensive, image-guided preclinical platform for accurate UHDR and CONV irradiation to investigate FLASH-mitigated spinal cord toxicity in rats. This work thus establishes a robust foundation for systematic evaluation of the FLASH effect in late-responding organs and for determining clinical applicability of FLASH.

*Setareh Hasanabadi,Mohammad Saber Azimi,Mehrdad Bakhshayesh Karam,Hossein Arabi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 本研究评估了部分容积校正（PVC）对淋巴瘤病灶中18F-FDG PET影像组学特征可重复性的影响，发现PVC显著提高了特征可重复性，特别是对于大病灶（>30 mL），而小病灶（<3 mL）稳定性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估PVC如何影响淋巴瘤病灶中18F-FDG PET影像组学特征的可重复性，考虑病灶体积和组织类型的差异，以支持标准化影像组学工作流程和可靠生物标志物开发。

Method: 回顾性研究131例新诊断淋巴瘤患者的基线18F-FDG PET/CT数据，对1,603个病灶进行半自动分割，提取93个影像组学特征，使用Richardson-Lucy和Reblurred Van Cittert算法进行PVC处理，通过变异系数和组内相关系数评估可重复性。

Result: PVC显著提高了特征可重复性，大病灶（>30 mL）的ICC2>0.90，小病灶（<3 mL）稳定性较低（ICC2=0.84-0.94）。一阶特征和GLCM特征最稳健（ICC2=0.92-0.99）。骨和脾病灶可重复性最高，淋巴结和肝脏特征变异性较大。

Conclusion: PVC显著增强FDG-PET影像组学在淋巴瘤中的可重复性，特别是对于较大和结构均匀的病灶。一阶和GLCM等稳健特征可支持标准化工作流程和可靠生物标志物开发，需要多中心验证以确认普适性。

Abstract: To evaluate how partial volume correction (PVC) affects the reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET radiomic features in lymphoma lesions, with respect to lesion volume and tissue type. This single-center retrospective study included 131 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients who underwent baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT. In total, 1,603 lesions (1,302 lymph nodes, 117 spleen/liver, 150 bone, and 34 bone/soft-tissue) were semi-automatically segmented and grouped by volume (<3, 3-10, 10-30, >30 mL) and tissue type. 93 radiomic features were extracted from non-PVC and PVC images processed with the Richardson-Lucy (RL) and Reblurred Van Cittert (RVC) algorithms following IBSI guidelines. Reproducibility was quantified using the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2, absolute agreement), with statistical comparisons performed via Mann-Whitney U tests and false-discovery-rate (FDR) correction. PVC significantly improved feature reproducibility, particularly for large lesions (>30 mL), with median ICC2>0.90 across most feature categories. Small lesions (<3 mL) showed lower stability (ICC2=0.84-0.94) and higher CoV (0.09-0.21). First-Order and GLCM features were the most robust overall (ICC2=0.92-0.99; CoV=0.07-0.11). Bone and spleen lesions exhibited the highest reproducibility (median ICC2 approx 0.95), whereas lymph-node and liver features were more variable. All volume- and tissue-dependent differences remained significant after FDR correction (p<0.05). PVC using RL and RVC markedly enhances FDG-PET radiomic reproducibility in lymphoma, particularly for larger and structurally uniform lesions. Robust features such as First-Order and GLCM can support standardized radiomics workflows and the development of reliable biomarkers for prognosis and personalized therapy. Multicenter validation is warranted to confirm generalizability beyond a single-center setting.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，学习的通信协议能显著提高通信效率，并以更高的成功率实现更好的协作性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提升多智能体系统的通信效率和协作效果，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效求解输运方程的稳态解，特别适用于处理干湿区域等复杂情况，在地形演化模型等实际应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We present and study a Particle method for the stationary solutions of a class of transport equations. This method is inspired by non-stationary Particle methods, the time variable being replaced by one spatial variable. Particles trajectories are computed using the ``time-dependent'' equations, and then the approximation is based on a quadrature method using the particle locations as quadrature points. We prove the convergence of the scheme under suitable regularity assumptions on the data and the solution, together with a ``characteristic completeness'' assumption (the characteristic curves fullfill the whole computational domain). We also provide an error estimate. The scheme is tested numerically on a two dimensional linear equation and we present a numerical study of convergence. Finally, we use this method to carry out numerical simulations of a landscape evolution model, where an erodible topography evolves under the effects of water erosion and sedimentation. The scheme is then useful to deal with wet/dry areas.

Result: 数值实验证明了NP-Newton方法在多个实际应用中的计算效率和鲁棒性，特别是在处理非常强的非线性问题时表现优异。

Conclusion: NP-Newton方法通过神经算子预处理有效解决了传统牛顿方法在不平衡非线性系统中的局限性，为强非线性问题提供了高效鲁棒的求解方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

*Phuc Tran,Van Vu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于轮廓分析的新方法来估计噪声矩阵低秩逼近误差‖Ã_p - A_p‖，通过引入衡量噪声矩阵与原始矩阵奇异向量偏斜度的新参数，在多种常见设置中显著改进了误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，我们通常只能获得带噪声的数据矩阵Ã = A + E，而下游任务使用的是Ã的最佳秩p逼近Ã_p而非A_p。因此准确估计‖Ã_p - A_p‖误差对数据科学应用至关重要。

Method: 基于轮廓分析的方法，引入测量噪声矩阵E与原始矩阵A奇异向量之间偏斜度的新参数，利用这些参数获得改进的误差界。

Result: 该方法在A本身具有相对低秩的常见情况下，显著改进了低秩逼近误差的估计精度，且具有独立的理论价值。

Conclusion: 提出的基于轮廓分析的新方法为低秩逼近误差估计提供了更精确的界限，特别适用于原始矩阵本身具有低秩的实际场景，该方法具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with rank $r$ and spectral decomposition $A = \sum _{i=1}^r σ_i u_i v_i^\top, $ where $σ_i$ are its singular values, ordered decreasingly, and $u_i, v_i$ are the corresponding left and right singular vectors. For a parameter $1 \le p \le r$, $A_p := \sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase "low-rank approximation". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\| \tilde A_p - A_p \|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代工程中对耦合旋转-平移信号高效处理需求的增长，需要开发适用于双四元数矩阵的广义奇异值分解工具。

Method: 提出了双四元数矩阵三元组(𝑨,𝑩,𝑪)的受限SVD和乘积-乘积SVD，这些分解可视为标准SVD的扩展，其特点在于对行空间和列空间应用不同的内积。

Result: 通过两个示例说明了这两种分解的可行性。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种广义奇异值分解为处理双四元数矩阵提供了有效的数值线性代数工具，能够适应现代工程中对旋转-平移信号处理的需求。

Abstract: In signal processing and identification, generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), related to a sequence of matrices in product/quotient form are essential numerical linear algebra tools. On behalf of the growing demand for efficient processing of coupled rotation-translation signals in modern engineering, we introduce the restricted SVD of a dual quaternion matrix triplet $(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B},\boldsymbol{C})$ with $\boldsymbol{A}\in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times n}$, $\boldsymbol{B} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times p}$, $\boldsymbol{C} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{q\times n}$, and the product-product SVD of a dual quaternion matrix triplet $(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{B},\boldsymbol{C})$ with $\boldsymbol{A}\in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{m \times n}$, $\boldsymbol{B} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{n \times p}$, $\boldsymbol{C} \in {\bf \mathbb{DQ}}^{p\times q}$. The two types of GSVDs represent a sophisticated matrix factorization that accounts for a given dual quaternion matrix in conjunction with two additional dual quaternion matrices. The decompositions can be conceptualized as an adaptation of the standard SVD, where the distinctive feature lies in the application of distinct inner products to the row and column spaces. Two examples are outlined to illustrate the feasibility of the decompositions.

### [105] [A polynomially accelerated fixed-point iteration for vector problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09012)
*Francesco Alemanno*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三点多项式加速器（TPA），用于解决定点迭代中误差模式衰减缓慢导致的残差平台问题，通过从残差动态推断主导收缩因子并构建正则化三点更新，显著减少映射评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定点过程经常因为某个误差模式衰减远慢于其他模式而减慢，导致基础迭代存在持续的残差平台。为克服这一障碍，需要开发一种高效且低成本的加速方法。

Method: TPA首先直接从残差动态推断主导收缩因子，然后从最后三个迭代点组装正则化的三点更新。该方法可嵌入现有定点算法中，修改和计算成本可忽略。

Result: 在线性系统（具有聚类特征值）、非线性tanh映射和离散泊松方程等测试套件中，TPA在达到指定容差时所需的映射评估次数明显少于Picard迭代、加权Jacobi/SOR和浅层Anderson方案，同时保持最小的内存和算术开销。

Conclusion: TPA是一种高效的多项式加速器，能够显著加速定点迭代收敛，在各种测试场景中表现优于传统方法，且具有计算成本低的优势。

Abstract: Fixed-point procedures frequently slow down because an error mode decays much more slowly than the others, leaving the base iteration with a persistent residual plateau. To counter this obstruction we formulate a three-point polynomial accelerator (TPA) that fits inside existing fixed-point algorithms with negligible modification and computational cost. TPA first infers the dominant contraction factor directly from the residual dynamics and then assembles a regularised three-point update from the last three iterates. We show that across a suite of tests: a linear system with clustered eigenvalues, a nonlinear tanh mapping, and a discretised Poisson equation, TPA attains a prescribed tolerance in markedly fewer map evaluations than Picard iteration, weighted Jacobi/SOR, and shallow Anderson schemes while preserving a minimal memory and arithmetic footprint.

Abstract: As a generalization of Hermite interpolation problem, Birkhoff interpolation is an important subject in numerical approximation. This paper generalizes the existing Generalized Recursive Polynomial Interpolation Algorithm (GRPIA) that is used to compute the Hermite interpolation polynomial. Based on the theory of the Schur complement and the Sylvester identity, the proposed recursive algorithms are applicable to a broader class of Birkhoff interpolation problems, where each interpolation condition is given by the composition of an evaluation functional and a differential polynomial. The approach incorporates a judgment condition to ensure the problem's well-posedness and computes a lower-degree Newton-type interpolation basis (which is also a strongly proper interpolation basis) along with the corresponding interpolation polynomial. Compared with existing algorithms that rely on Gaussian elimination to compute the interpolation basis, our recursive approach significantly reduces the computational cost.

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和数值实验中都表现出优异的性能，为加权Korobov空间中的函数逼近提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for function approximation in a weighted Korobov space based on shifted rank-1 lattice rules. To mitigate aliasing errors inherent in lattice-based Fourier coefficient estimation, we employ $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^{d} )$ good shifts and recover each Fourier coefficient via a least-squares procedure. We show that the resulting approximation achieves the optimal convergence rate for the $L_{\infty}$-approximation error in the worst-case setting, namely $\mathcal{O}(N^{-α+1/2+\varepsilon})$ for arbitrarily small $\varepsilon>0$. Moreover, by incorporating random shifts, the algorithm attains the optimal rate for the $L_{2}$-approximation error in the randomized setting, which is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-α+\varepsilon})$. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a high-order finite volume method for the Poisson problem based on the reduced discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) space. The main idea is to employ the RDG space as the trial space and the piecewise constant space as the test space, thereby formulating the scheme in a Petrov-Galerkin framework. This approach inherits the local conservation property of finite volume methods while benefiting from the approximation capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin spaces with significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We establish a rigorous error analysis of the proposed scheme: in particular, we prove optimal-order convergence in the DG energy norm and suboptimal-order convergence in \(L^2\) norm. The theoretical analysis is supported by a set of one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, which confirm both the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The significance of this work lies in bridging finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methodologies through the RDG space, thus enabling finite volume schemes with a mathematically rigorous convergence theory.

Abstract: We consider linear reaction-diffusion equations posed on unbounded domains, and discretized by adaptive Lagrange finite elements. To obtain finite-dimensional spaces, it is necessary to introduce a truncation boundary, whereby only a bounded computational subdomain is meshed, leading to an approximation of the solution by zero in the remainder of the domain. We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation. Based on this estimator, we devise an adaptive algorithm that automatically refines the mesh and pushes the truncation boundary towards infinity. We prove that this algorithm converges and even achieves optimal rates in terms of the number of degrees of freedom. We finally provide numerical examples illustrating our key theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半收敛阶段式框架，通过顺序整合一阶和高阶TV正则化器来平衡噪声抑制和结构保留，利用ADMM实现迭代恢复过程，并通过选择-传播机制将局部半收敛转化为全局收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像恢复需要在噪声抑制和结构保留之间取得平衡。一阶TV能有效保留边缘但会产生阶梯伪影，高阶TV能消除伪影但会过度平滑细节。为了调和这些竞争效应，需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 采用半收敛阶段式框架，在ADMM迭代过程中顺序整合一阶和高阶TV正则化器。每个阶段监测半收敛行为，选择局部最优迭代点作为下一阶段的初始点，通过选择-传播机制实现全局收敛。

Result: 理论分析表明阶段式迭代序列有界且目标函数值单调递减。在去噪和去模糊基准测试中，该方法在定量和感知性能上优于传统一阶、高阶、混合TV方法以及基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在保持理论可解释性和算法简洁性的同时，实现了优于现有方法的性能，成功平衡了噪声抑制和结构保留的竞争需求。

Abstract: Image restoration requires a careful balance between noise suppression and structure preservation. While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity.

Abstract: We propose a fast collocation method based on Krylov subspace iterative solver on general nonuniform grids for the fractional Laplacian problem, in which the fractional operator is presented in a singular integral formulation. The method is proved to be uniquely solvable on general nonuniform grids for $α\in(0,1)$, provided that the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation is sufficiently accurate. In addition, a modified scheme is developed and proved to be uniquely solvable on uniform grids for $α\in(0,2)$. Efficient implementation of the proposed fast collocation schemes based on fast matrix-vector multiplication is carefully discussed, in terms of computational complexity and memory requirement. To further improve computational efficiency, a banded preconditioner is incorporated into the Krylov subspace iterative solver. A rigorous maximum-norm error analysis for $α\in(0,1)$ is presented on specific graded grids, which shows that the convergence order depends on the grading parameter. Numerical experiments validate the predicted convergence and demonstrate the efficiency of the fast collocation schemes.

Abstract: Healthcare data are generated in many different formats, which makes it difficult to integrate and reuse across institutions and studies. Standardisation is required to enable consistent large-scale analysis. The OMOP-CDM, developed by the OHDSI community, provides one widely adopted standard. Our framework achieves schema-agnostic transformation by extending upon existing literature in using human-readable YAML specification to support both relational (Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)) and document-based (MongoDB) data sources. It also incorporates critical production readiness features: provenance-aware mapping and support for incremental updates. We validated the pipeline using 2.7 million patient records and 27 million encounters across six hospitals spanning two decades of records. The resulting OMOP-CDM dataset demonstrated an acceptable level of data quality with a 97% overall passing rate based on the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard check. Our work provides a reusable blueprint for large-scale data harmonisation, directly supporting real-world medical data research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

Method: 开发了一类混合动态-静态算法，通过以不同速率更新系统参数来最大化能量效率。其中捏合位置可通过可移动元件动态调节，而耦合则通过改变捏合元件的有效耦合长度来调节。

Result: 实验结果表明，动态调节捏合位置可以显著提升PASSs的能量效率。

Conclusion: 动态调节捏合位置是提升PASSs能量效率的有效方法，混合动态-静态算法能够有效优化系统性能。

Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.

Conclusion: LB-IF-TEM提供了一个低功耗、通信高效且分析可处理的基于时间的信号编码和重建框架。

Abstract: Integrate-and-fire time encoding machines (IF-TEMs) provide an efficient framework for asynchronous sampling of bandlimited signals through discrete firing times. However, conventional IF-TEMs often exhibit excessive oversampling, leading to inefficient encoding for signals with smoothly distributed information. This letter introduces a linear-bias IF-TEM (LB-IF-TEM), where the bias dynamically tracks the input signal to maintain a nearly constant integrator input, thereby localizing the firing intervals. The resulting concentrated distribution enables effective non-uniform quantization with reduced distortion. Theoretical analysis establishes explicit bounds on the achievable oversampling range, while experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method attains comparable reconstruction accuracy at significantly lower bitrate than existing IF-TEM variants. The LB-IF-TEM thus provides a low-power, communication-efficient, and analytically tractable framework for time-based signal encoding and reconstruction.

Conclusion: 所提出的结构化潜在空间合成方法能够有效提高EMG信号组合运动分类的准确性，克服了传统线性组合假设的局限性。

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal pilot pattern design, in the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator sense, for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels. To enable analytical tractability, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the Kronecker product of two Hermitian Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the delay and Doppler domains. By invoking the Szegö limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given.

Abstract: Recent work on wireless radiance fields represents a promising deep learning approach for channel prediction, however, in complex environments these methods still exhibit limited robustness, slow convergence, and modest accuracy due to insufficiently refined modeling. To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: in typical scenarios, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) is reduced by 14.3 dB versus state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic analysis of inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISCI) modeling in doubly dispersive channels for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We propose a generalized OFDM (Weyl-Heisenberg) framework to evaluate four ISCI treatment approaches: (1) explicit estimation and compensation, (2) complete ignorance, (3) uncorrelated colored noise approximation, and (4) correlated colored noise modeling. Through continuous delay-Doppler channel characterization, we derive LMMSE channel estimators and corresponding estimation errors (as sensing metrics) for both pilot-assisted and fully-known symbol scenarios. The communication performance is quantified via ergodic capacity bounds under imperfect CSI. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal fundamental performance-complexity trade-offs, providing insights for practical ISAC waveform and receiver design in doubly dispersive channels.

Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.

Abstract: Recently, the pinching-antenna system (PASS) has emerged as a promising architecture owing to its ability to reconfigure large-scale path loss and signal phase by activating radiation points along a dielectric waveguide. However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.

Abstract: Channel charting (CC) is a self-supervised positioning technique whose main limitation is that the estimated positions lie in an arbitrary coordinate system that is not aligned with true spatial coordinates. In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data. Our results for a simulated indoor scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the relative mean distance error by 29% compared to the state of the art. We also show that the proposed approach is robust to DT modeling mismatches and a distribution shift in the testing data.

Motivation: 现有检测器主要针对相位失真设计，缺乏对幅度和相位硬件损伤的联合处理能力，需要开发统一的检测框架来应对实际收发器损伤。

Method: 将收发器失真建模为残余幅度和相位噪声，在极坐标域设计近似相位幅度失真检测器(PAD-D)，采用失真感知加权策略。

Conclusion: PAD-D为实际收发器损伤下的检测提供了统一实用框架，基于该框架优化的星座设计进一步提升了性能，验证了分析SEP近似的准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents a maximum-likelihood detection framework that jointly mitigates hardware (HW) impairments in both amplitude and phase. By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs.

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-consistent framework for bistatic sensing incorporating a 2-Dimensional (2D) waveguide-fed metasurface antenna array capable of realizing eXtremely-Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (XL MIMO) apertures. A coupled-dipole model is presented that captures the array's mutual coupling due to both waveguide and free-space interactions, and a novel passivity constraint on the corresponding magnetic polarizabilities is proposed. Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.

Abstract: The sensitivity of the acoustic detection subsystem in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) critically affects image quality. However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression. This work offers a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems.

Abstract: Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing technology with broad industrial applications. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing.

Conclusion: 所提出的降低复杂度多模型编码方法能够有效优化电力信号压缩，在保持重构质量的同时提高压缩效率。

Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.

We show that modulations in the delay-Doppler, chirp and time-sequency domains are non-selective, predictable and equivalent to one another, whereas time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.

Abstract: To enable intelligent beam training, a large language model (LLM)-enabled beam training framework is proposed for the pinching antenna system (PASS) in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. A novel LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism is developed, allowing context-aware and environment-adaptive probing for PASS to reduce overheads. Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams. Based on pretrained Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), the LLM is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) For single-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS attains over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and achieves 51.92% improvements in beamforming gains compared to conventional method. ii) For multi-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS framework significantly outperforms both the LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training, achieving up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate, respectively.

Designing digital receivers that can scale to these array dimensions presents significant challenges regarding both channel estimation overhead and digital computation. This paper presents a computationally efficient and low-overhead receiver design based on long-term beamforming. The method combines finding a low-rank projection from the spatial covariance estimate with a fast polynomial matrix inverse. Ray tracing simulations show minimal loss relative to complete instantaneous beamforming while offering significant overhead and computational gains.

Conclusion: 基于MRC的流体天线系统在Rician衰落信道下能够有效提升性能，所提出的分析方法为系统设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna system (FAS) where a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a fluid antenna (FA) over a Rician fading channel. Considering that multiple ports among the M available FA ports can be activated, the receiver selects the best K with the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and combines the received signals at the selected ports using maximum ratio combining. The statistics of the post-combining SNR are derived using a Laplace transform-based approach, which allows to analyze the outage probability (OP) of the FAS. Additional closed-form expressions for a lower bound on the OP and the asymptotic OP at high SNR are presented. Numerical results validate the analytical framework and demonstrate the interplay of key system parameters on the performance of the considered MRC-based FAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在医学图像分割中仅使用少量标注数据时性能受限的问题，充分利用医学数据中丰富但常被忽视的分层信息。

Method: 提出SAMora框架，在图像、补丁和像素级别应用互补的自监督学习目标，并引入HL-Attn分层融合模块来整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在Synapse、LA和PROMISE12数据集上的实验表明，SAMora优于现有SAM变体，在少样本和全监督设置下均达到最先进性能，同时将微调周期减少90%。

Conclusion: SAMora通过分层自监督学习有效提升了SAM在医学图像分割中的性能，兼容多种SAM变体，具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语义通信需要同时压缩模态间冗余并在信道失真下提高语义可靠性，这是当前面临的关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段变分信息瓶颈方法：第一阶段对单模态分别压缩，通过互信息最小化模块抑制跨模态依赖；第二阶段对融合表示进行多模态压缩以增强信道失真鲁棒性。

Result: 在多模态情感识别任务上的实验结果表明，该框架在准确性和可靠性方面显著优于现有基线方法，特别是在低信噪比条件下。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个联合优化模态特定压缩、模态间冗余和通信可靠性的原则性框架。

Abstract: Semantic communications for multi-modal data can transmit task-relevant information efficiently over noisy and bandwidth-limited channels. However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Our work provides a principled framework that jointly optimizes modality-specific compression, inter-modal redundancy, and communication reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着阿尔茨海默病疾病修饰疗法获得监管批准，迫切需要基于最低成本测量方式的早期、客观和准确临床诊断。

Method: 使用持久同调分析脑部结构MRI，将拓扑特征通过Betti函数转换为特征向量，并与XGBoost等简单机器学习模型集成。

Result: 在ADNI 3D MRI疾病诊断中，模型在二分类任务中达到97.43%的平均准确率和99.09%的敏感度，在三分类任务中达到95.47%的平均准确率和94.98%的敏感度。

Conclusion: 该方法不需要数据增强或大量预处理，特别适合小数据集，拓扑特征与深度学习模型提供完全不同的信息类型，具有与其他模型结合的潜力。

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式比特分配的高效ROI图像压缩模型，通过Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement模块和双解码器实现区域自适应编码，在保持背景质量的同时显著提升率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ROI图像压缩方法主要采用显式比特分配策略，通过掩码抑制背景信息后进行量化，这种硬门控方法显著影响熵模型的统计分布，限制了压缩模型的编码性能。

Method: 提出Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement模块（包含Region-Adaptive Attention和Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention块），采用双解码器分别重建前景和背景图像，实现隐式比特分配。

Result: 在COCO2017数据集上的实验表明，该方法在率失真性能上显著优于显式比特分配方法，同时重建的背景区域保持令人满意的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用隐式比特分配实现高质量区域自适应编码的工作，证明了隐式比特分配在ROI图像压缩中的优越性。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低场MRI虽然具有更广泛的可及性，但存在信噪比低、空间分辨率差和对比度偏离高场标准的问题。图像到图像的转换可以将ULF图像映射到高场外观，但由于配对的训练数据稀缺，效果有限。

Method: 在ULF-EnC挑战赛约束条件下（50个配对的3D体积；无外部数据），研究任务适应的数据增强如何影响标准的深度模型用于ULF图像增强。采用强大多样的增强方法，包括在高场数据上的辅助任务。

Result: 研究显示，强大多样的数据增强显著提高了保真度。提交结果在公共验证排行榜上按脑掩模SSIM排名第三，在最终测试排行榜上按官方得分排名第四。

Conclusion: 任务适应的数据增强方法，特别是包含辅助任务的多样化增强策略，能够有效提升超低场MRI图像增强的性能，在数据稀缺的情况下实现更好的图像质量。

Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Imageto- image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和抽象意义表示(AMR)图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需要与代码交互，需要一种方法让非专业人士能够使用ASP解决组合逻辑问题。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后从简化语言解析AMR图，系统性地生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，相比完全依赖LLM的方法，本系统最小化了LLM的作用。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重要第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，在保持高效性的同时实现了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育场景中从答案提供者转向智能导师，但现有监督微调方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力。强化学习方法面临两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解，以及无法实时感知学生认知状态变化。

Method: 提出单向认知优化（UCO）方法，采用多轮交互强化学习范式。创新点在于两个协同奖励函数：进度奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估学生是否从困惑转向理解；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区（ZPD），鼓励教师在此区域内保持高效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型与11个基线模型比较，结果显示UCO模型在同等规模模型中表现最优，性能可与先进闭源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过多轮交互强化学习和协同奖励机制，有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的认知状态感知和动态适应问题，在教育场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征，结构化多智能体管道能有效提升推理质量。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性能力，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：自动化预测准备（构建多源认知基础）和生成推理与反思优化（触发元推理循环进行持续自校正）。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的逐步协作，显著提升了时序预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化，仅需1/10的数据即可达到67.7%的平均求解准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差，需要开发数据效率更高的自动化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过监督微调从有限标注数据学习问题建模和代码生成模式，然后通过测试时组相对策略优化提升能力和一致性。

Result: OR-R1在仅使用ORLM所需1/10合成数据的情况下，平均求解准确率达到67.7%，比ORLM高出4.2%；仅用100个样本就超过ORLM 2.4%；TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化OR优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业OR应用的专业知识和数据壁垒。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的管道，通过新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)来解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在提高推理效果的同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1经常生成包含冗余推理步骤的冗长响应(过度思考现象)，显著增加计算成本。现有方法通过长度惩罚存在长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的管道，并引入具有结果奖励与简洁性评分显式依赖关系的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)，从理论上证明新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛特性方面的优势。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的广泛实验显示，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应令牌长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在提高推理准确性的同时显著减少了计算成本，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Motivation: 智能AI系统虽然能在各种应用中提供更有帮助的AI系统，但其可靠性不足使其不适合高风险领域。不可靠系统在运行期间可能产生意外行为，需要缓解技术。

Method: 基于智能AI系统的特性推导其主要可靠性挑战，提出双层次可靠性监控框架：包括用于新输入检测的分布外检测层和揭示内部操作的AI透明度层。

Result: 该框架为操作员提供了判断输出是否可能不可靠并介入所需的决策支持，为开发缓解运行期间可靠性不确定风险的技术奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次监控方法为解决智能AI系统运行可靠性问题提供了有效解决方案，能够降低因可靠性不确定带来的风险。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块处理不规则临床时间序列数据，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等问题，现有嵌入策略通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症和慢性护理的三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse作为处理不规则临床时间序列的通用化方法，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖性和多尺度周期性模式与不规则波动共存的挑战，需要有效处理这些因素以提高预测准确性。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，包含混合周期性表示模块（使用可学习周期性嵌入和时空注意力）和频率感知残差表示模块（在频域使用复值MLP），并引入双视图对齐损失来强制语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，同时在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和残差分量，有效解决了交通预测中的关键挑战，为智能交通系统提供了准确可靠的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大语言模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练范式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：从第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、搭建训练数据的顺序框架。

Result: 预期这种训练语料库的重新设计将导致从第一个训练token开始的早期价值承诺，使知识、技能和价值观本质上更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大语言模型能力开始超越人类的生态系统中，这种从模型训练转向模型培养的范式转变是至关重要的需求。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Conclusion: 前沿大语言模型在规划任务上取得了实质性进步，缩小了与专业规划器在挑战性基准测试中的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，评估模型在真实创意领域中的程序能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行的功能评估。基准涵盖针法分类、指令落地、自然语言到DSL转换和图像到DSL转换等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了表面理解与真实世界创意领域中可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Motivation: 传统AI安全方法依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成充分共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受Vyas等人可证明版权保护算法启发。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过从模型集合中的未知安全子集放大安全保证到单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而物理AI将智能视为身体、环境和经验之间真实互动涌现的现象，需要建立新的理论基础。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

With only 0.945 million parameters, our model is well-suited for real-time deployment in wearable health monitoring systems.

### [164] [Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新颖的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提升递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但训练计算成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了更广泛的应用和研究。需要开发更高效的训练方法。

Method: CGAR包含两个协同组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度，从浅到深配置；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失权重与观察到的梯度幅度衰减对齐。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集（423,168个测试谜题）上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时，成本降低42%），精度仅下降0.63%（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独可实现2.26倍加速和85.47%精度。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现训练效率和解决方案质量的同时提升，是罕见的帕累托改进。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

*Philipp Anthes,Dominik Sobania,Franz Rothlauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似性生成子代程序，在24个数据集上显著优于传统GP方法，并能通过目标语义距离平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义GP方法依赖固定语法变换，TSGP旨在学习能产生相似语义的多样化结构变异，提升符号回归性能。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离生成语义相似的子代程序，实现语义空间中的可控搜索。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP平均排名1.58，显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，且生成更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP通过transformer模型实现了有效的语义搜索，目标语义距离提供了平衡探索与利用的有效机制，在符号回归任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Feynman-Kac（FK）引导框架，将其应用于基于扩散的蛋白质设计，能够在生成过程中引导采样朝向特定的功能或生化目标，如结合亲和力或序列组成，同时保持扩散过程的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的蛋白质结构生成模型难以控制生成结果朝向特定的功能或生化目标，如结合亲和力或序列组成，这限制了它们在蛋白质设计中的应用。

Method: 将FK引导框架与结构生成相结合，通过在推理时间进行控制，引导采样朝向理想的结构或能量特征。为了同时生成序列和结构属性，使用ProteinMPNN和全原子松弛精炼模型来计算奖励。

Result: 在结合剂设计中，FK引导一致改善了不同靶点的预测界面能量学，且计算开销最小。该方法能够推广到任意、不可微分和奖励无关的目标。

Conclusion: 推理时间FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分和奖励无关的目标，为引导分子生成提供了一个统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题，旨在在Gromov-Wasserstein几何框架下开发有效的图结构简化方法，以处理大规模图数据。

Method: 提出了两种算法：GPC（贪婪对粗化）迭代合并局部失真最小的节点对；KGPC（k均值贪婪对粗化）基于成对失真度量的聚类直接合并节点簇。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务上的验证表明，所提方法在广泛参数和场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法能够有效简化图结构，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个面向脑电图分析的基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知掩码重建策略，解决了跨设备数据差异和低信噪比两大挑战，在多个下游任务和跨域场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同记录设备和配置导致的数据集间变异性，(2)EEG信号的低信噪比问题，其中脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声淹没。

Method: 提出位置通道嵌入编码空间信息，采用噪声感知掩码重建策略在原始和潜在空间进行训练，引入字典启发的卷积变换层将信号投影到结构化特征空间，减少噪声敏感性。

Result: 在来自不同设备的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的位置通道嵌入和噪声鲁棒性设计，为EEG分析提供了一个设备无关且噪声鲁棒的基础模型，显著提升了跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts. The models and code are available at: https://github.com/Emotiv/EEG-X

Conclusion: TIGER通过显式建模智能体间协调结构的时序演化，有效提升了多智能体强化学习的协调能力和适应性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

TL;DR: ForeSWE是一个新的概率时空预测模型，结合深度学习和经典概率技术，用于预测雪水当量(SWE)，在西部美国512个SNOTEL站点数据上显示出比现有方法更好的预测精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策者具有重要价值。

Method: 提出ForeSWE模型，结合注意力机制整合时空特征和交互，以及高斯过程模块提供原则性的预测不确定性量化。

Result: 在西部美国512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，该模型在预测精度和预测区间方面相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现为水资源管理社区的部署和反馈提供了平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和1D CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，通过融入患者临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息，显著提升了睡眠分期准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工睡眠分期劳动密集且存在评分者间变异性，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：Transformer-based逐时段编码器 + 1D CNN聚合器，系统研究融入患者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧饱和度下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）的效果。

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）上，相比仅使用PSG的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，其中事件标注贡献最大增益。特征融合优于多任务学习替代方案。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表征融合可同时提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于频谱可预测性指标Ω的快速模型选择方法，该指标能在几秒内评估数据集是否适合使用大型时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)，从而显著降低模型验证成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际部署中面临的困境：全面验证数十个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用频谱可预测性指标Ω来系统性地分层模型家族性能，在四个不同领域进行控制实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω较高时，大型时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线，但当Ω下降时其优势消失。计算Ω仅需每数据集几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω指标能够可预测地分层模型性能，提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，既降低了验证成本，又突出了在真正困难(低Ω)问题上表现出色的模型的需求。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: DIVO通过精确的数据分布对齐和选择性扩展高优势动作边界，有效解决了离线强化学习中的保守主义与探索性平衡问题，取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

TGPT is designed to understand and generate transaction trajectories while simultaneously supporting a variety of downstream prediction and classification tasks. We introduce a novel 3D-Transformer architecture specifically tailored for capturing the complex dynamics in payment transaction data.

We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法基于触发激活变化识别后门神经元，但由于TAC值估计不准确导致识别精度低，需要更精确的TAC重构方法。

Method: 将最小扰动问题建模为凸二次优化问题，其最优解作为TAC的替代，通过检测扰动L2范数统计上较小的类别识别中毒类别，并在微调中利用该扰动移除后门。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于准确TAC重构的后门移除方法能够有效防御后门攻击，在各种场景下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型已成为新的SOTA，但传统生成模型仍有改进空间。作者希望改进条件变分自编码器，解决其生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题，并纠正先前工作中关于条件潜在空间分布的假设错误。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器框架，将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数进行训练，并使用归一化流来估计给定标签的条件潜在空间分布，而不是假设其等于先验分布。

Result: 相比现有方法，提出的方法将FID（弗雷歇起始距离）降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%，表明图像生成质量得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过将解码器方差作为可学习参数并使用归一化流正确建模条件潜在空间分布，可以有效改进条件变分自编码器的图像生成性能，在FID和对数似然指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE框架能够有效提高下游决策的可靠性，为微调后的大型语言模型提供校准的不确定性估计。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，现有不变学习方法难以准确捕捉不变特征并直接构建因果表示，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出FedSDWC因果推理方法，整合不变特征和变异特征，通过建模它们之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示。

Conclusion: FedSDWC通过因果推理方法显著提升了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的理论关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Result: 原型算法在多个IPE基准测试中表现出竞争力，包括推荐系统、多目标优化和大语言模型响应优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的IPE提供了潜力，展示了模型无关方法在稀疏反馈环境下的有效性。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种学习可定制距离度量的方法，用于处理分类属性数据的聚类分析，通过打破分类属性固有的关系约束，学习适合不同聚类结构的距离度量，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的距离度量和分类关系，显著增强了聚类算法的拟合能力，在分类属性聚类任务中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM生成的标签存在质量低（标签噪声）且缺乏错误校正机制的问题，需要提升标签质量。

Method: 提出HCL设置，仅对VLM存在差异的实例进行人工校正；推导风险一致估计器结合人工校正标签和VLM预测训练分类器；提出条件概率方法估计标签分布。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法获得优越的分类性能，对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HCL在弱监督场景中有效提升标签质量和分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在引入二阶优化时，由于局部预条件器的漂移问题，特别是在异构数据设置下，会显著干扰参数训练的收敛。

Method: 通过将理想二阶更新分解为服务器端的参数混合和客户端的局部参数更新，在服务器端引入预条件混合机制。

Result: 理论分析显示在强凸目标函数和单次局部更新场景下具有超线性收敛速率，实验结果表明相比传统方法在测试准确率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: FedPM方法通过预条件混合有效缓解了局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化在联邦学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实系统中的部署增加，理解其脆弱性变得至关重要。虽然RLHF/DPO对齐过程中的数据投毒攻击已有实证研究，但其理论基础仍不清楚。

Method: 将最小成本投毒攻击建模为带有线性约束的凸优化问题，推导攻击成本的下界和上界，并提出一种后处理方法减少所需标签翻转次数。

Result: 理论分析显示任何现有标签翻转攻击都可以通过后处理减少标签翻转次数。实证结果表明该方法能显著降低投毒成本，特别是在奖励模型特征维度相对于数据集大小较小时。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对抗低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: 所提出的链式框架能够有效估计全局和局部不确定性，在常用核函数上提供更紧的边界，且不依赖特定输入位置或后验方差缩放。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: GroupFS是一个端到端的无监督特征选择框架，能够联合发现潜在特征组并从中选择信息量最大的组，无需依赖预定义分组或标签监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常单独评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。虽然有些方法尝试捕捉组结构，但通常依赖预定义分区或标签监督，限制了应用范围。

Method: GroupFS通过强制特征图和样本图上的拉普拉斯平滑性，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑、结构化的表示，从而联合发现特征组并选择信息组。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类任务上持续优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS提供了一种有效的无监督特征选择方法，能够自动发现特征组结构并选择信息丰富的组，在各种数据类型上表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

TL;DR: DFDT提出了一种解决决策变换器跨域适应问题的新方法，通过两级数据过滤和优势条件标记来改善轨迹片段的缝合性和语义连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域策略适应方法依赖单一过滤标准选择源轨迹片段，但存在缝合性差的问题：状态结构不对齐、RTG不可比、动作在轨迹连接处跳跃，导致RTG标记失去连续性，影响DT的推理能力。

Method: DFDT使用两级数据过滤器（MMD不匹配用于状态结构对齐，OT偏差用于动作可行性），在可行性加权的融合分布上训练，用优势条件标记替换RTG标记，并应用Q引导正则化器抑制连接处的值和动作跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态学变化上，DFDT相比强离线RL和序列模型基线提高了回报和稳定性，并通过标记缝合和序列语义稳定性分析验证了这些增益。

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的缝合性和改进标记语义连续性，有效解决了决策变换器的跨域适应挑战，理论分析表明随着MMD不匹配和OT偏差的减小，性能差距界限会收紧。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

TL;DR: FSampler是一种无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用有限差分预测器从历史去噪信号中预测下一个epsilon，在特定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少扩散模型采样过程中的函数评估次数，从而加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，包含预测验证、学习稳定器和梯度估计稳定器，以及保护窗口、周期性锚点和连续跳过上限等机制。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler将时间减少8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。使用激进自适应门时，模型调用减少可达45-50%（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler是一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，无需训练即可与多种采样器集成，显著减少计算成本而不改变采样器公式。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Conclusion: DFA攻击揭示了联邦学习中新的安全威胁，GuardFed提供了一种有效的防御方案，在保护模型准确性和公平性方面达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Conclusion: MARBLE模型能有效处理非平稳环境中的决策问题，QWI算法在潜在状态切换下具有理论保证的收敛性。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Motivation: 随着复杂黑盒AI模型的普及，需要能够解释其决策的技术。特征归因方法已成为提供事后解释的流行解决方案，但该领域历来缺乏正式的问题定义。

Method: 提出了DFAX（Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations）方法，这是一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法，直接基于数据分布来解释分类器预测。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，DFAX比最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX是第一个直接基于数据分布来解释分类器预测的特征归因方法，能够克服现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: WOODELF是一种新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑整合到统一框架中，实现了线性时间计算背景SHAP值，在CPU和GPU上都能高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法效率较低，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。WOODELF旨在提供一种更高效的SHAP计算框架，支持多种博弈论值的计算。

Method: 为每个消费者构建伪布尔公式，捕获特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用该表示在线性时间内计算背景SHAP值。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有背景Shapley值仅需162秒，GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一种高效、可扩展的SHAP计算方法，支持多种博弈论值的计算，能够显著加速大规模数据集上的可解释性分析。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的PET成像需要支持无约束探测器布局的方法，从穿行设计到长轴环，其中间隙和开放侧会导致严重欠采样的正弦图。与其约束硬件形成完整圆柱体，不如将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验。

Result: 该方法能够处理严重欠采样的正弦图，支持各种非传统PET几何结构。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为开发新颖、成本效益高且患者友好的PET几何结构提供了可行的解决方案，有望在真实临床环境中应用。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CREAT的约束强化学习驱动的配置文件污染攻击方法，通过双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习来平衡攻击效果与隐蔽性，解决了现有配置文件污染攻击方法在细粒度扰动和可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列推荐系统容易受到对抗性攻击，但传统的数据投毒攻击需要大规模用户访问或虚假配置文件，缺乏实用性。配置文件污染攻击虽然只需污染部分用户交互，但现有方法存在对序列水平影响的过度依赖导致细粒度扰动受限，以及整体修改导致可检测分布偏移的问题。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层次优化框架与多奖励强化学习：1）开发模式平衡奖励策略，整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；2）采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态屏障约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动。

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT方法的有效性，能够在保持隐蔽性的同时实现目标污染攻击。

Conclusion: CREAT方法通过约束强化学习框架成功解决了配置文件污染攻击中的细粒度扰动和可检测性问题，为序列推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Method: 引入Abstract Gradient Training (AGT)统一框架，通过界定可达参数集（建立可证明的参数空间边界）来认证模型对训练数据扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: AGT为通过一阶优化方法训练的模型行为提供了形式化分析方法，能够处理有界扰动、数据点移除和新增样本等多种训练数据扰动类型。

Conclusion: AGT框架填补了训练数据扰动认证的研究空白，为对抗性数据投毒、机器遗忘和差分隐私等场景提供了统一的认证解决方案。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

TL;DR: CallosumNet是一个用于时空图完全遗忘的框架，通过增强子图构建和全局神经节桥接技术，能够高效地删除单个节点而无需完全重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求完全遗忘未经授权的数据，而现有方法主要针对静态图设计，无法有效处理时空图中节点信息在时空维度上的全局扩散问题。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，采用分治策略，包括增强子图构建（基于生物启发的虚拟神经节）和全局神经节桥接（重建全局时空依赖关系）。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CallosumNet能够实现完全遗忘，同时保持接近黄金模型的性能，为时空图数据遗忘提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PTE的保留数据无关的遗忘学习框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现高效知识编辑，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型即可完成，在多个基准测试中取得了遗忘效果与模型效用的良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态工业物联网环境中，模型需要能够选择性遗忘过时或错误知识，但现有方法依赖保留数据来约束模型行为，这会增加计算和能耗负担，并与工业数据孤岛和隐私合规要求相冲突。

Method: PTE将遗忘学习构建为探测-编辑过程：首先通过梯度上升探测模型在待遗忘类别决策边界邻域，利用模型自身预测生成编辑指令；然后执行推-拉协同优化：推分支使用编辑指令主动拆解目标类别的决策区域，拉分支应用掩码知识蒸馏将保留类别的知识锚定到原始状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTE在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，实现了遗忘效果与模型效用的良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型即可实现高效平衡的知识编辑，为动态工业物联网环境中的模型知识管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Conclusion: 该方法在知识图谱补全、推荐式链接预测等应用中有效，为LLM辅助的图机器学习提供了评估框架。

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 通过主要SEP事件的可解释性案例研究，展示了该方法如何提高可解释性，并促进对SEP事件预测的物理理解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案，展示了在嵌入空间中直接进行规划的可能性。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Motivation: 解决专门任务中监督微调需要高质量数据集但人工标注成本高昂的问题，特别是针对主观、开放式任务中现有自动化方法面临的冷启动问题（需要标注数据集进行奖励建模）。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，虽然专家设计的工作流获得更高的人类偏好率（96-99% vs AutoSynth的40-51%），但使用AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配或超越专家工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟（减少90%以上）。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、成本效益高的方法，能够发现超出人类直觉的质量维度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

*Arash Bahari Kordabad,Dean Brandner,Sebastien Gros,Sergio Lucia,Sadegh Soudjani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种二阶确定性actor-critic强化学习框架，利用性能函数的曲率信息来加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典确定性策略梯度方法，通过利用性能函数的二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）来改进学习效率，解决一阶方法收敛速度慢的问题。

Method: 基于兼容函数逼近概念引入二次critic，同时保留真实策略梯度和性能Hessian矩阵的近似；开发最小二乘时序差分学习方案高效估计二次critic参数；使用critic学习的信息进行准牛顿actor更新。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法相比标准确定性actor-critic基线实现了更好的收敛性和性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶框架能够有效利用曲率信息，为任何可微策略类提供通用的加速收敛方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenePheno是第一个可解释的多标签预测框架，直接从基因序列预测敲除诱导的表型异常，通过对比学习和生物学一致性约束实现多表型关联预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注特定基因变异对有限表型的影响，或依赖人工整理的遗传信息，难以直接从基因序列广泛预测多个表型异常。基因序列与表型之间存在大的模态差距和基因多效性，导致该任务尚未被充分探索。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕获表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制概念。

Result: 在四个数据集上，GenePheno在基因中心Fmax和表型中心AUC指标上达到最先进水平，案例研究证明其能够揭示基因功能机制。

Conclusion: GenePheno提供了一个可扩展、可解释的框架，能够直接从基因序列预测敲除诱导的多表型异常，为假设驱动的实验提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统评估AI系统心理风险的方法，通过分析18个真实案例，在2160个模拟场景中测试了4个主要LLM，揭示了AI在检测心理困扰、应对脆弱用户和防止伤害升级方面的关键缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益融入日常生活，其可能加剧或引发严重心理伤害的潜力仍未得到充分理解和测试，需要开发系统方法来探索AI交互中的心理风险。

Method: 收集分析18个真实案例，提取有害交互模式，使用临床分期模型在2160个模拟场景中测试4个主要LLM，分析157,054个对话轮次，进行回归和聚类分析。

Result: 发现LLM在检测心理困扰、应对脆弱用户和防止伤害升级方面存在关键缺陷；老年用户风险更高，低收入群体表现相对较好；识别出15种不同的失败模式，分为4类AI引发的伤害。

Conclusion: 本研究贡献了识别心理风险的新方法、系统常见失败模式的实证证据，以及对高风险人机交互中有害AI响应模式的分类体系。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, their potential to exacerbate or trigger severe psychological harms remains poorly understood and inadequately tested. This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm. This work contributes a novel methodology for identifying psychological risks, empirical evidence of common failure modes across systems, and a classification of harmful AI response patterns in high-stakes human-AI interactions.

*Kapil Garg,Xinru Tang,Jimin Heo,Dwayne R. Morgan,Darren Gergle,Erik B. Sudderth,Anne Marie Piper*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究评估了图像质量问题（如模糊和构图不当）如何影响视觉语言模型（VLM）为盲人和低视力人群生成产品识别描述的准确性。研究发现，在无质量问题时模型准确率达98%，但存在质量问题时降至75%，且问题叠加时表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型被盲人和低视力人群广泛用于日常产品识别，但缺乏关于图像质量问题如何影响模型准确性的实证研究，以及生成的描述是否满足用户信息需求。

Method: 基于对86名盲人和低视力人士的调查，系统评估图像质量问题对VLM生成描述的影响，包括模糊、构图不当等常见问题。

Result: 最佳模型在无质量问题的图像中产品识别准确率达98%，但存在质量问题时整体准确率降至75%，且随着问题叠加而显著恶化。

Conclusion: 需要以残障人士体验为中心的模型评估方法，并为HCI和ML研究人员提供具体建议，以提高VLM对盲人和低视力人群的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.

Motivation: 解决乘客在使用车载信息娱乐系统时的晕车问题，提升乘车舒适度和系统使用效率，特别是在自动驾驶车辆中这一需求更为重要。

Method: 创新设计SimPath视觉方案，在真实驾驶场景下进行两组实车实验，验证方案在非规则运动条件下的有效性。

Result: 该方法显著降低了乘客的晕车程度，但由于视觉内容分散注意力，未能直接提高车载信息娱乐系统的使用效率。

Conclusion: 为更智能友好的车载信息娱乐系统设计提供了重要见解，为未来自动驾驶车辆中的系统开发提供了理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: The problem of Motion Sickness (MS) among passengers significantly impacts the comfort and efficiency of In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems (IVIS) use. In this study, we innovatively designed SimPath, a visual design to effectively mitigate passengers' MS and boost their efficiency of using IVIS during driving. The study focuses on the problem of irregular motion conditions frequently encountered during actual driving. To validate the efficacy of this approach, two sets of real - vehicle experiments were carried out in real driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces passenger's MS level to a certain extent. However, due to divided attention from visual content, it does not directly improve the IVIS efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers crucial insights for the design of a more intelligent and user friendly IVIS, based on the discussion of the principle, providing strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the development of future IVIS in autonomous vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据是健康机器学习的重要数据源，但研究人员和临床医生在提取和验证数据时面临表达性和可用性之间的权衡，现有工具难以编写适应现代建模流程的时序查询。

Method: 开发了TempoQL工具包，提供简单的人类可读时序查询语言，支持OMOP、MEDS等多种EHR数据标准，并配备交互式笔记本查询界面和可选的大型语言模型编写辅助功能。

Result: 通过性能评估和两个不同数据集的用例，证明TempoQL在保持精确性、速度和可重复性的同时，简化了机器学习队列的创建过程。

Conclusion: TempoQL成功降低了EHR数据提取和验证的门槛，为研究人员和临床医生提供了更便捷的数据处理工具。

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在眼科应用中缺乏灵活性、可解释性和适应性，而眼科需要处理多种成像模式，因此需要开发一个全面的临床决策支持框架。

Method: 使用大语言模型DeepSeek-V3作为核心推理引擎，动态协调53个验证过的眼科工具，涵盖分类、分割、检测、图像/报告生成和定量分析等任务。

Result: 逐步消融分析显示诊断准确率从69.71%提升至80.79%；在200个真实临床案例中，工具选择准确率达93.7%，专家评分超过88%；在人机协作中，诊断准确率提升18.51%，报告质量评分提升19%。

Conclusion: EyeAgent被确立为眼科领域可扩展且值得信赖的AI框架，为模块化、多模态和临床对齐的下一代AI系统提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown promise in medical imaging, yet most existing systems lack flexibility, interpretability, and adaptability - challenges especially pronounced in ophthalmology, where diverse imaging modalities are essential. We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.

TL;DR: 算法建议在竞争性决策中作为战略信号发挥作用，个体化建议比集体建议影响更强，可能导致默示共谋行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究算法建议如何影响人类在经典经济博弈中的行为，特别是在具有独特均衡点的竞争环境中，探讨算法可能引发的共谋风险。

Method: 通过两个预注册实验：实验1使用伯特兰价格竞争模型，提供个体化或集体算法建议；实验2使用古诺数量竞争模型，提供均衡对齐或战略偏见的算法建议。

Result: 个体化建议对参与者行为影响更显著，在价格竞争中作为软性上限，在数量竞争中导致持续低产量和超竞争利润，表现出默示共谋特征。

Conclusion: 算法建议能够作为战略协调信号，无需明确沟通即可引发共谋行为，强调在竞争环境中需要谨慎设计和监督算法决策支持系统。

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在教育领域的实际效果，探索自然语言对话界面与传统搜索界面在学习成果上的差异，解决"交互-结果悖论"问题。

Method: 采用对照实验设计（N=20），直接比较LLM界面和搜索界面的学习交互过程和结果。

Result: LLMs界面引发更丰富、细致的交互，但未产生明显更好的学习成果。学习者认知焦点从信息搜索转向自我知识差距识别。

Conclusion: 教育技术评估需要新视角，未来学习工具设计应利用学生表达性来支撑生产性认知工作，而非单纯丰富交互。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在最优控制问题上的方法主要基于强化学习或在线学习，但这些方法与PAC学习框架存在数学差异。为了将PAC学习的成功扩展到控制问题，特别是在非平稳环境中，需要开发新的理论框架。

Method: 基于前瞻学习理论，提出了"前瞻控制"框架，将PAC学习扩展到非平稳环境中的学习和控制问题。使用经验风险最小化方法，并在觅食任务这一典型移动智能体任务中进行验证。

Result: 证明了在相当一般的假设下，经验风险最小化渐近达到贝叶斯最优策略。在觅食任务中，现有强化学习算法在非平稳环境中学习失败，即使经过修改，效率也比前瞻觅食智能体低几个数量级。

Conclusion: 前瞻控制框架成功地将PAC学习扩展到非平稳环境中的控制问题，为AI的未来最优控制提供了新的理论基础和高效算法。

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Result: 结果表明，即使是少量噪声的添加也会对模型性能产生显著影响。

Conclusion: 噪声对BCOPS算法的性能有显著影响，需要在模型部署时考虑训练数据质量的重要性。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Result: 在计算社会科学和调查研究的一系列真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，稳健采样确保了估计结果不会比均匀采样更差，且在不确定性估计可靠时优于标准主动推断。

Conclusion: 提出的稳健采样策略为AI辅助数据收集提供了可靠的统计推断方法，平衡了主动采样的优势与稳健性要求。

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]
