However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their\nempirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to\navoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor\ngeneralization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of\nSGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis\nand obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this\npaper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large\ndeviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp\ncharacterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we\nreveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then\ntruncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost\ncompletely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for\nthe test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical\nprediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with\na more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance."}

We address this challenge by introducing\nLLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic\nframework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of\ntwo components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the\ntemporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual\nobservations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that\nis adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode\ntextual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory.

While prior work has largely\nemphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity\nhas been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring\ndatasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a\nsingle-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly\ncounterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class\ndistribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional\nexpectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it\nwith rigorous proofs.\n  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical\ndomains: active learning and data imputation.

We demonstrate that an initial uniform\nexploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm\nachieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding\nbounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards.

We\nformulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine\nlearning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing\ndocument. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an\nexisting document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a\nmajority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision\nsimilarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that\npopular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because\ntheir scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity\nbetween two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is\na fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision\nScore (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content\nshared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,\nbefore comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a\nsurgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use\napproximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In\ncode-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy\nfor passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When\naligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest\ncompetitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures\nlike BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb\nHumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases\nto 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that\nother measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and\nappropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions."}

To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical\nSAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices\n(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD\ncost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by\njointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,\ncomputing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an\nNP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game\n(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to\noptimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the\npartially observable SAGIN-MEC system.

Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since\nit relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we\nstudy the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some\nstate-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate\na unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to\nclassification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical\nfashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process\nleaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the\ntopography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the\ncategories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural\nnetworks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data\nwill typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the\nclassical bias-variance trade-off.
