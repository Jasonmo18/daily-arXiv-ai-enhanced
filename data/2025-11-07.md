### [1] [Deep learning-based object detection of offshore platforms on Sentinel-1 Imagery and the impact of synthetic training data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04304)
*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星影像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，评估合成数据在提升海洋基础设施检测性能方面的效果，并在未见区域验证模型的地理可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋基础设施的快速扩张需要有效的监测系统，但现有模型在样本稀缺时性能不足，特别是对于代表性不足的物体类别、形状和尺寸。

Method: 结合合成和真实的Sentinel-1卫星影像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，在四个区域（里海、南海、几内亚湾、巴西海岸）进行训练，并在三个未见区域（墨西哥湾、北海、波斯湾）评估地理可迁移性。

Result: 模型共检测到3,529个海上平台（北海411个、墨西哥湾1,519个、波斯湾1,593个），F1分数达到0.85，加入合成数据后提升至0.90。

Conclusion: 合成数据生成是解决遥感中常见挑战的有效策略，能够增强不平衡类别的表示和整体模型性能，展示了深度学习在全球可扩展海洋基础设施监测方面的潜力。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源视频标注软件，专门用于标注动物行为中的交互，填补了现有工具在行为标注和个体定位整合方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么只支持行为标注而不定位个体，要么只定位个体而不支持交互标注，无法满足理解动物社交和个体化行为的需求。

Method: 开发了SILVI软件，将行为标注和个体定位功能整合，支持在视频数据中直接标注行为和交互，生成适合计算机视觉模型训练的结构化输出。

Result: SILVI成功实现了行为生态学与计算机视觉的链接，为细粒度行为分析提供了自动化方法，虽然主要针对动物行为开发，但也可用于标注人类交互。

Conclusion: SILVI填补了交互标注工具的市场空白，为理解动物社交行为提供了有效工具，并具有扩展到其他领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在COVID-19胸部X光检测中，通过噪声注入技术（高斯、斑点、泊松、椒盐噪声）来提升深度学习模型对分布外数据的泛化能力，显著缩小了分布内和分布外数据之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中容易学习源特定的伪影（捷径）而非合理的生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上泛化能力差，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中。

Method: 在训练过程中使用四种基础噪声注入技术：高斯噪声、斑点噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声，以增强模型对分布变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 噪声注入技术将分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距从0.10-0.20显著降低到0.01-0.06，基于十个随机种子的平均结果，涵盖AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标。

Conclusion: 基础噪声注入技术能有效提升COVID-19胸部X光检测模型对分布外数据的泛化能力，是解决深度学习模型泛化问题的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在X射线引导的脊柱手术中应用模仿学习策略的可行性，开发了一个高真实度的仿真环境来训练基于视觉信息的插管对齐策略，并在模拟和真实X射线图像上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模仿学习在X射线引导的脊柱手术（如椎弓根螺钉置入）中的应用潜力，因为多视图X射线的解释复杂，传统方法面临挑战。

Method: 开发了高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术仿真环境，收集了正确轨迹和对应双平面X射线序列的数据集，训练了基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略进行规划和开环控制。

Result: 策略在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，保持了安全的椎弓根内轨迹，能够泛化到复杂解剖结构（包括骨折），对不同的初始化保持鲁棒性，在真实X射线上也能产生合理的轨迹。

Conclusion: 虽然初步结果有希望，但在入口点精度方面存在限制，完全闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制，结合更强的先验知识和领域知识，这种方法可能为轻量级、无需CT的机器人术中脊柱导航提供基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于剪枝轻量化YOLOv12结合自对抗训练和专用数据增强的实时目标检测框架，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 使用基于剪枝轻量化YOLOv12的增强实时目标检测框架，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专用数据增强策略，在DroneTrashNet数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在精度、召回率和平均精度（mAP）方面取得显著改进，同时实现低延迟和紧凑模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的空中无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量化YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结果验证了结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法在沙漠环境中实现稳健实时垃圾检测的有效性。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类别的图像合成方法（Class-Based Image Composition），通过将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合图像（CoImg）来增强训练数据，解决了小样本、不平衡数据集和图像质量差导致的深度学习模型预测错误率高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本、不平衡数据集和图像质量差会导致深度学习模型产生高错误预测率，特别是在医学图像分析中，这种问题更为突出。

Method: 提出Class-Based Image Composition方法，将同一类别的多张图像融合成3x1布局的复合图像（CoImg），增强类内方差和信息密度。在OCTDL数据集上构建了完美类别平衡的Co-OCTDL数据集。

Result: 使用VGG16模型进行对比实验，提出的方法显著提高了诊断结果：准确率达到99.6%，F1-score为0.995，AUC为0.9996，相比原始数据集训练的基线模型有显著提升，错误预测率也显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法即使对于受类别不平衡或小样本影响的弱数据集，也能产生高质量的预测结果，证明了图像合成在改善深度学习模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037)
*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，通过低帧率指尖视频提取PPG信号，采用混合深度学习模型CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM实现98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其非侵入性采集、固有活体检测特性和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而受到生物认证领域的关注，但信号质量易受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要稳健的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集（46名受试者，14Hz采样率），对原始PPG信号进行预处理（基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化），通过连续小波变换将一维PPG段转换为二维时频尺度图，开发了结合CVT和ConvMixer空间特征与LSTM时间特征的混合深度学习模型。

Result: 在46名受试者上的实验结果显示认证准确率达到98%，验证了模型对噪声和个体间变异性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统具有高效性、可扩展性和固有活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种互补的时间动作定位方法：边界距离回归(BDR)通过有符号距离回归实现信息论最优定位，自适应时间细化(ATR)通过连续深度选择动态分配计算资源，在多个基准测试中显著提升了定位精度并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，但不同边界的难度差异很大，这导致了计算效率低下和定位精度不足的问题。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归(BDR)：使用有符号距离回归替代分类，实现信息论最优定位；2. 自适应时间细化(ATR)：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]动态分配计算资源，实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: BDR使边界峰值锐度提升43%，在多种架构上带来1.8-3.1%的mAP@0.7提升；ATR在THUMOS14上以162G FLOPs达到56.5% mAP@0.7，相比均匀处理的53.6%提升了2.9%且计算量减少18%；在短动作上提升达4.2%。

Conclusion: 所提出的BDR和ATR方法有效解决了时间动作定位中边界难度差异问题，显著提升了定位精度和计算效率，并通过知识蒸馏降低了训练成本，在多个基准测试中验证了有效性。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [9] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的高斯-网格联合优化框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何和顶点颜色，实现高质量3D重建并支持下游编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在几何精度和真实感渲染之间权衡，将几何和外观优化解耦，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。本文主张统一处理几何和外观优化以实现无缝的高斯-网格联合优化。

Method: 提出新颖框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法线、深度图的几何正则化。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可以进一步用于下游编辑任务，如重新光照和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了几何和外观的统一优化，为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了高质量的3D重建基础。代码将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性分数变换参数的轻场相机标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列实现准确的内参标定，包括最小二乘解析解和非线性优化，并提供了特征检测和快速仿真能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻场相机在3D重建中需要准确的内参标定，但这是一个具有挑战性的前提条件。现有方法在标定主镜头和微透镜阵列时存在耦合问题。

Method: 提出线性分数变换参数α来解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包括基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，同时介绍了从原始图像中检测特征的方法。

Result: 在物理和模拟数据上的实验验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的原始轻场图像仿真速度更快，这对数据驱动的深度学习方法至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了轻场相机内参标定的挑战，为3D重建提供了可靠的标定基础，同时提升了仿真效率，支持深度学习应用。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Room Envelopes合成数据集，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，以理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致重建不完整，忽略了被遮挡的结构元素（如墙壁、地板、天花板）。这些结构元素相对容易预测，因为它们通常是平面、重复且简单的。

Method: 创建Room Envelopes合成数据集，包含RGB图像和两个关联的点图：一个捕捉可见表面，另一个捕捉移除家具后的结构布局表面。使用该数据集直接监督前馈单目几何估计器。

Result: 该方法能够预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面，从而理解场景的完整范围以及物体的形状和位置。

Conclusion: Room Envelopes数据集为场景结构元素的重建提供了有效的监督方式，使得单目几何估计器能够更全面地理解场景布局。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个用于3D高斯场中语言指代分割的框架，通过引入相机感知机制和跨视图监督，解决了现有方法在多视图一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视图特定特征学习，导致跨视图一致性差，需要改进3D几何与语言的跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，以及训练配对视图监督(ITPVS)来对齐不同视图的高斯logits。

Result: 在三个基准测试上分别实现了16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU提升，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CaRF框架实现了更可靠和视图一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr是一个统一的框架，用于建模、评估和优化视频生成中的物理一致性，通过PhysicsRM奖励模型和PhyDPO优化方法显著提升物理真实性。


<details>

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在感知质量上取得进展，但生成内容经常违反物理合理性原则，表现为不合理的物体动态、不连贯的交互和不真实的运动模式，这阻碍了在具身AI、机器人和仿真密集型领域的应用。

Method: 提出PhysicsRM（首个双维度奖励模型）量化物体内部稳定性和物体间交互，开发PhyDPO（新型直接偏好优化管道）利用对比反馈和物理感知重加权来引导生成物理一致的输出。该方法与模型无关且可扩展。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PhysCorr在保持视觉保真度和语义对齐的同时，在物理真实性方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着物理基础和可信赖的视频生成迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

TL;DR: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现近乎无损的保真度，保持锐度和内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于等值面的体素化表示严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，不可避免地损害几何保真度。

Method: Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器用于可扩展和细节保持的形状重建。

Result: 在表示方面达到10^-5级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer Distance减少93%，F-score提高35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D学习任务的表示和重建方面，在准确性和效率上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，并将视觉和大脑表征投影到共享潜在空间，实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法直接将神经活动与视觉嵌入对齐的局限性，因为纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。

Method: 将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性，采用两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练+多模态微调），并引入不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于现有最先进方法，特别是在200-way EEG检索任务中提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过语言锚定的多模态对齐方法，有效解决了神经信号解码中的语义捕获问题，提高了视觉语义从神经信号中提取的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了两种无配对自监督CT图像去噪方法：基于CycleGAN的残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器，发现CycleGAN在最终图像质量上表现最佳，而Noise2Score在无配对情况下提供稳健替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无配对和自监督条件下的CT图像去噪，评估两种训练数据效率高的范式，为缺乏干净配对数据的情况提供解决方案。

Method: 使用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器，通过配置扫描确定最佳参数设置（lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64的U-Net架构），并进行长时间训练。

Result: CycleGAN将输入质量从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升至38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM，获得1.9441估计分数和1.9343未见集分数；Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊但对高噪声输入有显著改善。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score在无干净配对时提供具有竞争力的稳健替代方案，两者各有优势。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，无法精确控制生成图像中对象的位置。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督来细化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到了新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上实现了超过0.9的IOU分数。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像合成中的对象定位问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG是一种无需训练的扩散采样加速策略，通过将分类器自由引导ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著减少计算量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散采样方法计算成本高，作者发现噪声估计和额外引导项对数值误差的敏感性不同，存在可优化的计算冗余。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在精细时间步网格上计算（乌龟方程），额外引导仅在粗网格上计算（兔子方程），并引入自适应时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG将函数评估次数减少高达30%，生成质量损失极小（ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032），在相同计算预算下优于现有CFG加速方法。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新思路，为实现无需模型重新训练的高质量实时图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，需要改进风格引导能力。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，将参考特征作为辅助信息结合线性平滑，使用风格-内容引导机制，避免自注意力中键值矩阵覆盖，并扩展支持多风格生成的联合AdaIN模块。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现高质量的草图生成，具有准确的风格对齐和更好的风格控制灵活性，尤其在参考与目标草图结构相似度低时表现更佳。

Conclusion: M3S框架有效解决了草图风格控制问题，通过创新的风格引导机制提升了生成质量和灵活性，为可控草图生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available
at https://github.com/CMACH508/M3S.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向确定是一个关键的预处理步骤。准确的旋转校正对于提升下游任务（如OCR）的性能至关重要，因为用户错误（特别是拍摄时的错误基础方向）经常导致图像错位。

Method: 首先引入ORB基准测试，包括ORB-En（基于旋转变换的英文OCR数据集）和ORB-Indic（涵盖11种印度语言的新多语言数据集）。然后提出了一个基于Phi-3.5-Vision模型视觉编码器的快速、鲁棒且轻量级的旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪技术，专门针对4类旋转任务进行微调。

Result: 该方法在两个数据集上分别实现了96%和92%的旋转识别准确率。在模拟真实世界设置中，该模块显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了评估OCR旋转鲁棒性的新基准，还开发了一个高效的旋转校正模块，证明了其在提升OCR性能方面的重要作用。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用至关重要，但不同染色或成像模态之间的配准具有挑战性。

Method: 使用20个组织样本对，应用多种预处理步骤（包括CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane颜色转换、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），采用VALIS配准方法进行刚性和非刚性配准，通过相对目标配准误差(rTRE)评估性能。

Result: 在两种场景（原始或反转多模态图像）中，CycleGAN颜色转换均实现了最低的配准误差，而其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 配准前应用颜色转换可改善不同模态图像之间的对齐，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动风格迁移中表现不足，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特性，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出自适应统计融合器(AStF)，包含风格解耦模块(SDM)和高阶多统计注意力机制(HOS-Attn)，并结合运动一致性正则化(MCR)判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过更全面地建模动态风格的时空统计模式，AStF在运动风格迁移方面表现出优于现有技术的熟练度优势。

Conclusion: 引入偏度和峰度等更高阶统计量能够更有效地捕捉运动数据的复杂动态特性，为运动风格迁移提供了更全面的统计建模方法。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型因其空间姿态定位的优化特性，为解剖标志点检测提供了强大的先验知识，这一潜力此前未被充分挖掘。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型的日益复杂，源归属和真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战。扩散模型在输出中无意间留下了持久的统计痕迹（信号泄漏），这为溯源提供了机会。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在域中操作，通过部分前向扩散重模拟来暴露生成器特定的残留线索。使用时序注意力编码器聚合多步潜在特征，特征加权原型头构建嵌入空间并实现透明归属。

Result: 仅使用闭集数据训练，达到98.13%的宏AUC，学习的潜在几何结构在后处理下保持鲁棒，超越现有最先进方法，在已知和未知生成器之间实现强可分离性。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证，为合成媒体溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Conclusion: DinoGRL框架通过结合DINOv2先验和步态特征学习，有效提升了跨模态视频行人重识别的性能，证明了步态特征在跨模态匹配中的重要性。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS是一种新颖的3D高斯溅射加速框架，通过基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，解决了训练时间与渲染质量之间的权衡问题，实现了显著的训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法未能有效调节高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销，需要一种能够平衡训练速度和渲染质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，摒弃预算机制，充分考量每个高斯的的重要性。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上相比DashGaussian实现3.32倍训练加速，在Deep Blending数据集上相比原始3DGS实现15.45倍加速，在各种任务中实现2-7倍训练加速。

Conclusion: FastGS展示了强大的泛化能力，在动态场景重建、表面重建、稀疏视图重建、大规模重建和SLAM等多种任务中都能提供显著的训练加速效果。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本研究通过自监督学习在大型农业数据集上训练领域特定的视觉基础模型，显著提升了除草剂试验中的物种识别和损伤分类性能，特别是在未见过的条件和领域迁移场景下表现更佳，同时大幅减少了人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度物种和损伤类型区分方面性能有限。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法在大型精选农业数据集上训练领域特定的视觉基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富且可迁移的表征。

Result: 领域特定模型在物种识别（F1分数从0.91提升至0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26提升至0.33）上显著优于最佳通用基础模型。在未见条件下表现更佳（物种识别从0.56到0.66；损伤分类从0.17到0.27），在领域迁移场景如无人机图像中保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定的基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V是一个创新的文本到视频生成框架，通过集成提示词重述和语义特征提取到单一流程中，解决了现有模型在简洁提示词下视频质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但在简洁提示词下往往无法保持视频质量，且无法在线重述提示词以更好地匹配用户意图。

Method: 提出重述适配器模块，使扩散模型能够在LLM的下一个令牌预测过程中使用文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件，将基础提示词隐式重述为更全面的表示。

Result: RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，适用于不同的视频扩散模型架构，显著提升了文本到视频模型生成高质量、符合用户意图视频的能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成提示词重述和语义特征提取，有效解决了文本到视频生成中的语义对齐问题，增强了模型的可扩展性和可用性。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了传感器遮挡对BEVFusion架构3D物体检测性能的影响，发现在nuScenes数据集上，相机遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%，LiDAR在重度遮挡下mAP下降47.3%，融合设置中LiDAR遮挡影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索传感器遮挡（如雾、霾或物理障碍物）对基于BEV表示的3D物体检测精度的影响，这一问题在现有研究中尚未充分探讨。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构，在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和LiDAR传感器遮挡对3D检测性能的影响，使用mAP和NDS作为性能指标。

Result: 相机中度遮挡导致仅相机检测mAP下降41.3%；LiDAR重度遮挡导致mAP下降47.3%；融合设置中相机遮挡仅造成4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降。

Conclusion: 模型对LiDAR的依赖更强，需要开发遮挡感知评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术以应对部分传感器失效或环境条件恶化的情况。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: HideAndSeg是一个用于分割章鱼视频的AI工具，结合SAM2和YOLOv11，通过最小化监督实现自动化分割，并引入无监督指标评估分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼的伪装能力、快速皮肤变化、非刚性变形和频繁遮挡，加上水下光照和浑浊度变化，分析自然栖息地中的章鱼具有挑战性。缺乏大规模标注数据集也限制了相关研究。

Method: 集成SAM2与自定义训练的YOLOv11目标检测器。用户提供点坐标生成初始分割掩码，然后训练YOLO模型，最后通过边界框提示实现全自动化分割流程。引入两个无监督指标：时间一致性DICE_t和新组件计数NC_t。

Result: HideAndSeg实现了令人满意的性能，相比手动提示方法减少了分割噪声。即使在完全遮挡后也能重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下会失败。

Conclusion: 该工作通过减少真实场景中手动分析的需求，为野生头足类动物的行为研究提供了实用工具，开辟了更高效的研究途径。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: 滑坡对生命、基础设施和环境造成严重破坏，需要准确及时的测绘用于灾害准备和响应。传统深度学习模型在不同传感器、区域或训练数据有限的情况下表现不佳，因此需要更稳健的方法。

Method: 使用三轴分析框架（传感器、标签、领域）适配地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0，采用全球预训练、自监督学习和可适应微调策略。

Result: 该模型在滑坡测绘任务中一致优于任务特定的CNN（U-Net、U-Net++）、视觉变换器（Segformer、SwinV2-B）和其他GeoFMs（TerraMind、SatMAE），对光谱变化具有韧性，在标签稀缺情况下保持准确性，并在不同数据集和地理环境中更可靠地泛化。

Conclusion: GeoFMs为滑坡风险减少和环境监测提供了更稳健和可扩展的方法，但仍面临计算成本高和可重用AI训练数据有限等挑战。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Method: 提出了包含三个维度（质量、自然度、同步性）的8个指标评估框架，强调效率和与人类偏好的对齐，分析头部、嘴巴、眉毛的细粒度动态以及面部质量。

Result: 实验表明，虽然许多算法在唇部同步方面表现出色，但在生成表情丰富和无伪影细节方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

TL;DR: STC-Net是一个用于腹腔镜胆囊切除术中基于Parkland分级量表自动评估手术复杂度的框架，能够在完整手术视频上进行单时间戳的复杂度估计，无需手动剪辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估手术复杂度对于腹腔镜胆囊切除术至关重要，严重炎症与更长手术时间和更高并发症风险相关。Parkland分级量表提供了临床验证的炎症严重程度分层框架，但其在手术视频中的自动化应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了STC-Net框架，通过定位、窗口提议和分级模块联合执行时间定位和分级。引入了结合硬软定位目标和背景感知分级监督的新型损失函数，在弱时间监督下直接从完整视频操作。

Result: 在1,859个LC视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，在两项指标上均比非定位基线高出10%以上。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整LC视频进行自动化PGS手术复杂度评估的可扩展有效方法，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的通用前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合学习鲁棒的动态场景重建，解决了稀疏非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战时存在困难，需要开发能够鲁棒重建动态场景的框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架捕获几何和语义场景上下文，引入高效融合机制在3D支架内直接操作实现时空对齐，设计双分支解码器结合点锚定细化和基于体素的生成来生成动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniSplat在新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，即使在原始相机覆盖范围之外的视点也能提供鲁棒和高质量的渲染。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一的潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中动态场景重建的挑战，实现了鲁棒和高质量的3D重建效果。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过在CLIP模型中同时支持视觉提示输入和处理长文本描述，实现了细粒度的图像-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注提升视觉信息处理的粒度，但CLIP文本编码器的token长度限制阻碍了处理更细粒度文本信息的能力。

Method: 首先构建自动化标注流程生成像素级定位的长文本描述，创建LongGRIT数据集；然后用LLM替换CLIP的文本编码器，提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架。

Result: 实验表明PixCLIP在像素级交互和处理长文本方面取得突破，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同提升视觉和文本内容处理粒度，有效增强了细粒度视觉语言对齐能力。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化、基于准确性的框架来评估虚拟免疫组化染色图像质量，发现传统图像保真度指标与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性差，而配对模型在染色准确性方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型可以从H&E图像生成虚拟IHC染色，但可靠的图像质量评估仍然是一个挑战，因为当前的纹理和分布指标量化的是图像保真度而非IHC染色准确性。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成每个虚拟IHC模型预测的棕色染色像素掩码，通过计算真实和虚拟IHC分割掩码的染色准确性指标（Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离）来直接量化像素级标记准确性。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性差；配对模型如PyramidPix2Pix和AdaptiveNCE达到最高染色准确性；全玻片图像显示在基于补丁的评估中不可见的性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量定义了一个可重复的方法，这是加速向病理学家常规使用转化的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且无需人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构来预测全参考指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在主要限制：全参考指标需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注训练，且大多数无人工标注的无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频对象检测的关键时域上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时域感知卷积架构直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能够泛化到各种退化类型；与广泛使用的有标注图像质量评估基线BRISQUE相比，与全参考指标的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 时域建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，验证了时域感知、无人工标注方法的有效性。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种诊断和去偏多模态基准测试的方法，通过测试集压力测试和迭代偏置剪枝来识别和减少非视觉偏差，确保模型评估的真实视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在基准测试中可能通过利用偏差、语言先验和表面模式而非真正的视觉理解能力来获得高分，这影响了评估的有效性。

Method: 采用测试集压力测试方法，通过仅使用测试集的非视觉文本输入对大型语言模型进行k折交叉验证来揭示捷径性能，并结合基于随机森林的轻量级诊断；使用迭代偏置剪枝程序过滤高偏差样本。

Result: 在四个基准测试（VSI-Bench、CV-Bench、MMMU和VideoMME）中发现了普遍的非视觉偏差，通过应用该框架创建了VSI-Bench-Debiased，减少了非视觉可解性并扩大了视觉盲性能差距。

Conclusion: 提出的诊断和去偏框架能有效识别和减轻多模态基准测试中的非视觉偏差，提高评估的真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面表现不佳，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实世界视频数据存在瓶颈，因此需要开发模拟数据生成框架来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出SIMS-V系统数据生成框架，利用3D模拟器的特权信息创建空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融实验分析问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别，仅用25K模拟示例训练的7B参数视频LLM在真实世界空间推理基准上超越72B基线模型，并与专有模型竞争，同时保持通用视频理解性能。

Conclusion: 模拟数据能够有效开发可迁移的空间智能，通过精心选择的关键问题类型可以实现高效训练，在保持通用性能的同时显著提升具体空间任务的表现。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了从反应式任务驱动系统向空间超感知的转变，强调需要超越纯语言理解的四个阶段：语义感知、流式事件认知、隐式3D空间认知和预测性世界建模。作者开发了VSI-SUPER基准测试，发现仅靠数据扩展无法实现空间超感知，而预测性感知方法显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态智能系统主要停留在反应式任务驱动和长上下文处理，缺乏真正的空间认知能力。需要推动从纯语言理解向空间超感知的转变，以发展更全面的多模态智能。

Method: 提出了空间超感知的四个阶段框架，开发了VSI-SUPER基准测试（包括VSR和VSC任务），创建了VSI-590K数据集并训练Cambrian-S模型，同时提出了基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器方法。

Result: 数据扩展使VSI-Bench性能提升30%，但在VSI-SUPER上表现仍有限。预测性感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线，表明预测性方法对空间超感知至关重要。

Conclusion: 仅靠规模扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要能够预测、选择和组织经验的模型。预测性感知为空间超感知提供了可行路径，模型不仅要看到还要能够预测和构建内部世界模型。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Result: 在VBench上获得83.74分，大幅超越所有自回归模型，甚至超过HunyuanVideo等扩散模型；生成5秒720p视频的速度比领先的基于扩散的方法快约10倍，是第一个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成器。

Conclusion: InfinityStar证明了统一时空自回归框架在高分辨率图像和视频生成中的有效性，为高效、高质量的视频生成研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体经常经历状态转换，现有方法在物体外观发生显著变化时容易丢失跟踪目标，需要解决这一限制。

Method: TubeletGraph系统首先识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后对添加的轨迹进行推理并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Result: TubeletGraph在状态转换下实现了最先进的跟踪性能，同时展示了对物体转换的深入理解以及在复杂物体转换的时间定位和语义推理方面的有前景能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了物体在状态转换过程中的跟踪问题，提供了对物体状态演化的更深入理解，并发布了新的基准数据集VOST-TAS。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过提取大语言模型中基于大五人格特质（开放性、尽责性、外向性、宜人性和神经质）的隐藏状态激活，发现低秩子空间，并识别跨不同模型架构的特质特定最优层，实现人格对齐方向的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成过程中表现出隐含的人格特质，但可靠地控制或调整这些特质以满足特定需求仍是一个开放挑战。需要有效的机制来在生成过程中操纵模型行为，而人格感知的LLMs是实现这一目标的有前景方向。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的流水线：从transformer层提取基于大五人格特质的隐藏状态激活，应用低秩子空间发现方法，识别不同模型架构中特质特定的最优层，并通过动态层选择的灵活引导框架操作化人格对齐方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

*Eugenius Mario Situmorang,Adila Alfa Krisnadhi,Ari Wibisono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextualVerifier是一个针对TextGrad的自我验证框架，通过思维链分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合四阶段工作流程，解决文本推理的有效性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad作为文本自动微分方法缺乏自我验证机制，无法确保文本推理的有效性，这限制了其在复合AI系统中的可靠应用。

Method: 采用思维链推理和多数投票机制，集成到TextGrad的损失函数和优化结果验证阶段，实现非侵入式验证。

Result: 在PRM800K上推理步骤有效性提升29%；集成到TextGrad后在GPQA-Diamond、MMLU-ML和MMLU-CP基准上分别获得8.08、10.71和3.92个百分点的改进，平均增加5.9次LLM调用。

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于LLM技术的TextGrad自我验证框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的推理，为文本优化验证开辟了新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定长度的token片段来引导模型生成，显著提高计算效率和对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如微调）计算成本高且效果不佳，而推理时方法（如Best-of-N采样）需要不切实际的计算量才能达到最优对齐。

Method: 提出STARS算法：在解码时对短固定大小的token片段进行迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受，实现生成路径的早期修正。

Result: 在六个LLM上的实验表明，STARS在胜率上比监督微调(SFT)高出14.9个百分点，比直接偏好优化(DPO)高出4.3个百分点，与强Best-of-N基线保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 细粒度、奖励引导的采样是传统微调和全序列排序方法的一种通用、鲁棒且高效的大语言模型对齐替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多标签文本分类中的效率问题，特别是针对短文本推理场景，同时保持分类准确性。

Method: 将多标签分类任务重构为一系列二分决策序列，每个目标维度独立查询；结合前缀缓存机制；使用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏技术，通过强大标注模型生成多个标注来微调较小模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在训练过的维度上相比零样本基线有显著提升，在情感文本分析中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二分查询，结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理，为基于LLM的分类提供了一个可扩展且有效的框架，该方法具有通用性，可应用于多个领域。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据收集往往重数量轻质量，这可能导致技术性能不佳和产生有害内容，因此需要调查这些数据集的质量问题。

Method: 通过分析三种低资源语言的机器翻译数据集，重点考察性别代表性，包括人名性别分布、动词语法性别和刻板印象描绘等方面。

Result: 发现训练数据主要包含政治和宗教领域文本，而基准数据集集中在新闻、健康和体育领域；数据集存在严重的男性性别偏见，在女性语言中发现了更多有害和有毒内容，且数据量最大的语言问题最突出。

Conclusion: 数据量不能保证质量，需要进一步调查低资源语言数据集并及早减轻有害内容，希望研究能激发更多相关调查。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识源，但基于提示的接地方法脆弱且领域敏感，符号知识集成需要高检索和格式化成本。受知识图谱启发，希望找到更轻量级的幻觉缓解方案

Method: GRAD通过单次前向传播在小型检索语料库上累积下一令牌对数构建稀疏令牌转移图，在解码时对图检索的对数进行最大归一化，并与模型对数自适应融合，优先选择高证据延续

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD始终优于基线方法，内在准确率提高9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，在所有方法中获得最高的真实性-信息性乘积分数

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的替代方案，证明语料库级别的令牌转移统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实和可验证的输出

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在从自然语言指令生成SQL时面临模式规模大和复杂推理的挑战，先前工作多关注复杂不实用的管道，而忽略了更小更高效的模型。

Method: 提出了三种多智能体LLM管道：(1)多智能体讨论管道，智能体迭代批评和优化SQL查询，由法官合成最终答案；(2)规划器-编码器管道，思考模型规划器生成逐步SQL生成计划，编码器合成查询；(3)编码器-聚合器管道，多个编码器独立生成SQL查询，推理智能体选择最佳查询。

Result: 在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev集上的实验显示，多智能体讨论能提升小模型性能，Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct经过三轮讨论后执行准确率提升10.6%。LLM推理器-编码器管道效果最佳，DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B规划器将Gemma 3 27B IT准确率从52.4%提升至最高的56.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM管道能有效提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，特别是对于较小模型，其中规划器-编码器管道表现最优，为构建更高效的SQL生成系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

Method: 使用迭代参考游戏实验，改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性，比较人类和视觉语言模型在不同条件下的表现。

Result: 在没有相关上下文时，模型表现高于随机但远逊于人类；在有相关上下文时，模型性能随试验次数显著提升；使用抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏对机器学习模型仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 上下文相关性对模型性能有重要影响，相关上下文能显著提升模型表现，但抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏仍是机器学习模型的难点。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个计算图灵测试框架来评估LLM生成文本的真实性，并在多个社交媒体平台上系统比较了9个开源LLM的校准策略，发现即使经过校准，LLM输出仍与人类文本有明显差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会科学研究中广泛使用LLM模拟人类行为，但缺乏对LLM生成文本真实性的可靠验证工具，现有评估方法主要依赖人类判断，存在局限性。

Method: 引入计算图灵测试框架，结合聚合指标（BERT检测性和语义相似度）与可解释语言特征（风格标记和主题模式）；系统比较9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现，包括微调、风格提示和上下文检索。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出仍明显可区分于人类文本，特别是在情感基调和情感表达方面；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不会增强人类相似性；存在权衡：优化人类相似性往往以牺牲语义保真度为代价。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM模拟提供了可扩展的验证和校准框架，同时也警示了当前LLM在捕捉人类交流方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体设置中，语言模型通常通过明文token传递消息，这丢弃了大部分潜在语义，限制了信息传输并增加了不必要的计算开销。

Method: 通过训练双编码器翻译器在Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct模型之间建立潜在桥梁，使用学习到的映射实现表示空间之间的直接语义交换。

Result: 训练的双编码器翻译器实现了0.538的平均余弦对齐度，在30%混合强度下注入翻译向量可以引导目标模型的生成而不破坏对数概率的稳定性。双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性。

Conclusion: 这种保守的注入方法保持了计算稳定性，同时证明了跨模型潜在通信是可行的，使得协作AI系统能够共享意义而非token。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个将溯因推理整合到检索增强生成(RAG)中的框架，通过检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提并进行验证，提高RAG系统在知识密集型任务中的准确性和推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG管道在检索证据不完整时常常失败，导致推理过程中存在空白。溯因推理作为一种生成合理缺失前提来解释观察结果的原则性方法，可以弥补这些空白。

Method: 提出一个集成溯因推理到检索增强LLMs的框架，包括检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提，以及通过一致性和合理性检查进行验证。

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳问答基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法提高了答案准确性和推理可信度。

Conclusion: 溯因推理是增强RAG系统鲁棒性和可解释性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了T-FIX基准，用于评估LLM在知识密集型领域中的解释与专家直觉的对齐程度，开发了新的度量标准来衡量LLM解释与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方案主要关注解释的合理性或内部忠实度，未能捕捉解释内容是否真正符合专家直觉，特别是在知识密集型领域（如手术、天文学、治疗）中，用户需要反映专家级推理的解释。

Method: 与领域专家合作，开发了新的度量标准来测量LLM解释与专家判断的对齐度，构建了T-FIX基准，涵盖七个知识密集型领域。

Result: 提出了专家对齐作为评估解释的标准，并建立了T-FIX基准来系统评估LLM解释在知识密集型领域的专家对齐程度。

Conclusion: 需要超越传统的解释评估标准，关注解释内容与专家直觉的对齐，T-FIX基准为评估LLM在专业领域的解释质量提供了新的框架。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

*Xinying Qian,Ying Zhang,Yu Zhao,Baohang Zhou,Xuhui Sui,Xiaojie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了PoK框架，通过知识规划和对比时序检索器来解决时序知识图谱问答中的复杂时间约束理解问题，显著提升了LLMs在时序推理中的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分理解时间约束的复杂语义信息，而LLMs虽然具有强大的语义理解和推理泛化能力，但在时序推理方面存在幻觉和知识缺乏的问题。

Method: 提出PoK框架，包含知识规划模块将复杂时序问题分解为子目标序列，以及构建时序知识存储库和对比检索框架来选择性检索语义和时间对齐的事实。

Result: 在四个基准TKGQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，PoK显著提高了LLMs的检索精度和推理准确性，最多超过最先进TKGQA方法56.0%的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化规划和时序知识检索，PoK有效增强了时序推理的可解释性和事实一致性，为时序知识图谱问答提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类与大型语言模型在词汇联想行为上的差异，特别是对情感词汇的联想反应，发现LLMs的联想与人类有中等程度重叠，但更倾向于放大刺激的情感负荷，且更可预测、缺乏创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类词汇联想是研究心理词典的重要方法，但人类反应受个人经验、情感和认知风格影响，难以预测。研究旨在探索LLMs是否能像人类一样生成词汇联想，特别是对情感词汇的反应。

Method: 通过比较人类与大型语言模型对情感词汇的联想行为，分析两者在联想方式上的相似性和差异。

Result: 人类与LLMs的联想重叠度中等，但LLMs倾向于放大刺激的情感负荷，其联想更可预测且缺乏人类联想的创造性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词汇联想方面与人类存在显著差异，其联想行为更加模式化、情感放大化，且缺乏人类特有的创造性联想能力。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Motivation: 提升放射学报告的自动去标识化能力，通过扩展训练数据集来增强Transformer模型性能，并与商业云供应商系统在PHI检测方面进行基准测试。

Method: 基于最先进的Transformer PHI去标识化流水线，在两个大型斯坦福大学注释放射学语料库上进行微调，引入额外的PHI类别(AGE)，使用"隐藏式"方法评估合成PHI生成的稳定性，并与商业系统进行性能比较。

Result: 模型在Penn数据集上获得0.973的总体F1分数，在斯坦福数据集上获得0.996，超越了之前的最先进模型性能。合成PHI评估显示在50个独立去标识化Penn数据集中检测一致性良好(总体F1: 0.959)，模型在合成Penn报告上优于所有供应商系统(总体F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754)。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的去标识化模型在多样化放射学数据集上训练，在PHI检测方面超越了先前的学术和商业系统，为安全临床文本处理建立了新基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [69] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言识别问题，提出了k列表识别的新框架，给出了精确的数学特征化，并建立了统计学习环境下的收敛速率界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的语言识别理论存在局限性，Gold和Angluin的研究表明传统框架下无法识别多数有趣的语言集合。受近期语言生成研究的启发，本文探索通过允许学习者每次输出k个猜测来突破这一限制。

Method: 基于Angluin经典特征化的递归版本，提出了k列表识别的数学特征化方法，并建立了与统计学习理论的联系。

Result: 给出了k列表识别的精确特征化：语言集合可被k列表识别当且仅当可分解为k个可被单列表识别的子集合。在统计设置下，证明可k列表识别的集合能以指数速率收敛，而不可识别的集合则无法以任何速率收敛到零。

Conclusion: k列表识别框架有效扩展了语言识别的能力边界，提供了理论上的突破，并为实际应用中的近似识别提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索批处理在大语言模型中的额外益处，特别是作为多步推理的正则化机制，而不仅仅是推理成本的优化策略。

Method: 在13个多样化基准测试上进行全面研究，通过详细的行为分析考察批处理对模型推理行为的影响。

Result: 批处理显著提高了准确性，同时大幅减少推理令牌使用（通常3-5倍），抑制过度思考，减少犹豫语言，促进更果断的答案，并观察到批处理中的涌现集体效应。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是吞吐量优化工具，更是实现更高效可靠LLM推理的强大推理时正则化器。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: RIDE是一个基于项目反应理论的对抗性问题重写框架，用于评估LLMs的真实数学推理能力，通过生成不同难度的问题变体来测试模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务上的高表现可能源于训练数据泄露或表面模式匹配，而非真正的推理能力，需要更严格的对抗性评估方法。

Method: 使用项目反应理论测量问题难度，通过35个LLMs模拟学生构建难度排序器，在强化学习中指导问题重写模型生成不同难度的数学问题变体。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，RIDE生成的问题变体使26个先进LLMs的平均性能下降21.73%，暴露了数学推理的有限鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效揭示了LLMs数学推理能力的局限性，验证了该评估方法的有效性，为更真实的数学推理评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

TL;DR: CantoASR是一个协作式ASR-LALM错误校正框架，通过整合强制对齐进行声学特征提取、LoRA微调的Whisper改进音调识别，以及指令调优的Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知校正，显著提升了低资源粤语的自动语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源粤语ASR面临标注数据有限、六种词调、变调和口音变化等挑战，现有模型如Whisper词错误率较高，需要整合声学线索与LALM推理能力。

Method: 提出CantoASR框架：1) 使用强制对齐提取声学特征；2) LoRA微调Whisper改进音调识别；3) 指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知校正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上的评估显示，相比Whisper-Large-V3取得了显著的字符错误率提升。

Conclusion: 将声学线索与LALM推理相结合，为低资源音调语言和方言ASR提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: LAAC提出将LLM作为智能通信中介，通过结构化对话捕捉发送者意图，促进真实知识交换，避免AI生成内容的膨胀和压缩循环。本文系统评估了LAAC在多个通信领域部署的可信度要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容泛滥导致通信剧场化，发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，双方都不接触真实内容。需要新的通信范式来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过控制实验评估LAAC多智能体架构的三个可信维度：信息捕获保真度、可重现性和查询响应完整性。

Result: 初步发现显示存在可测量的信任差距，在LAAC可靠部署到高风险通信场景前必须解决这些问题。

Conclusion: LAAC作为通信中介的部署面临可信度挑战，需要在信息保真度、一致性和可靠性方面进一步改进才能在高风险场景中可靠使用。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

Conclusion: 尽管技术进步迅速，当前大语言模型尚无法在波兰公共采购裁决中替代人类法官或独立考官，存在幻觉、法律条款引用错误、逻辑论证薄弱等关键限制。

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

TL;DR: REMIND是一种新的机器学习遗忘评估方法，通过分析模型在输入微小变化下的损失模式来检测未学习数据的残余影响，比现有单点评估方法更敏感和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘评估方法通常只在单个输入层面评估遗忘效果，可能忽略语义相似示例中的残余影响，这会危及隐私并导致间接信息泄露。

Method: REMIND通过分析模型在输入微小变化下的损失动态模式来检测残余记忆，发现未学习数据产生更平坦、陡度较小的损失景观，而保留或无关数据则表现出更尖锐、更易变的模式。

Result: REMIND仅需基于查询的访问，在类似约束条件下优于现有方法，并在不同模型、数据集和转述输入中表现出鲁棒性，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: REMIND为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了一个更敏感和可解释的可靠框架，为记忆和遗忘提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的方法来为主题模型生成有意义的标签，该方法通过丰富主题词并分析其关系来提升可解释性，在保持计算效率的同时获得了与ChatGPT-3.5相当的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型生成的主题词分布缺乏清晰的可解释性，且大多数方法计算成本高昂。本文旨在开发一种计算效率高的方法来为主题分配有意义的标签。

Method: 采用基于图的方法，不仅丰富主题词的语义相关术语，还探索它们之间的关系，通过分析图中的连接来推导合适的标签。

Result: 在两个不同数据集上与多个基准方法（包括ChatGPT-3.5）进行比较，在BERTScore和余弦相似度方面始终优于传统基准方法，结果与ChatGPT-3.5相当，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 图基方法为话题标签提供了一种计算效率高的解决方案，未来研究方向包括增强可解释性和自动化。

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO是一种新的强化学习算法，采用句子级别的重要性比率，在GRPO和GSPO之间取得平衡，避免了训练崩溃和低采样数据利用率的问题，并在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR算法如GRPO和GSPO分别存在策略更新不稳定和采样数据利用率低的问题，需要一种平衡的解决方案。

Method: 提出SSPO算法，应用句子级别的重要性比率，并结合句子熵来调整PPO-CLIP的裁剪边界，鼓励高熵token探索并缩小低熵token的裁剪范围。

Result: SSPO在五个数据集上的平均得分为46.57，超过了GRPO（43.01）和GSPO（44.42），并在三个数据集上达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: SSPO通过采用GSPO的优点但避免其缺点，有效利用了生成数据，在强化学习训练中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于机器翻译系统微调的数据选择方法，通过定义可学习性评分来评估数据点的训练效用，结合批量选择策略优化训练效率，在多个语言对上实现了5倍数据效率提升和24%计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量及其有效选择是提高机器翻译模型性能的基础，对于构建稳健可靠的翻译系统至关重要。

Method: 利用学习器模型和预训练参考模型之间的协同作用，定义可学习性评分来系统评估数据点的训练效用，并采用考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批量选择策略。

Result: 在英语到波斯语等多个语言对上的实验表明，该方法相比iid基线实现了5倍的数据效率提升，使用缓存嵌入时计算效率提升24%，并获得了优于随机选择方法的翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能数据选择显著提高了机器翻译系统的训练效率和性能，证明了数据选择在模型微调中的重要性。

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在时间推理任务上的表现，特别是当要求模型以特定历史时期的视角回答问题时。

Method: 使用1940年挪威书籍中的琐事问题，用英语和挪威语两种语言提示LLMs回答问题，采用LLM-as-judge方法进行评分，并由母语者抽样检查。

Result: 英语提示始终比挪威语提示效果更好，这是意外结果；使用更大的LLMs能改善结果；测试了DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3、Llama3.1等模型家族以及专门为挪威语定制的最大的LLM。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间推理任务上表现出一定的能力，但语言选择对结果有显著影响，英语提示优于挪威语提示，模型规模对性能有积极影响。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

TL;DR: PTTSD是一个概率性文本时间序列抑郁检测框架，通过临床访谈的逐句文本预测PHQ-8抑郁评分，同时建模时间不确定性，在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上达到文本系统的最高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁严重程度预测模型缺乏不确定性估计和时间建模能力，而准确且可解释的预测对临床决策支持至关重要。

Method: 提出PTTSD框架，包含序列到序列和序列到单值两种变体，结合双向LSTM、自注意力机制、残差连接，使用高斯或Student-t输出头通过负对数似然训练。

Result: 在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上，PTTSD在纯文本系统中达到最优性能（E-DAIC上MAE=3.85，DAIC上MAE=3.55），产生良好校准的预测区间。消融实验确认了注意力和概率建模的价值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过三部分校准分析和定性案例研究，突显了不确定性感知预测的可解释性和临床相关性，为抑郁检测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态基准测试主要关注高资源语言，泰语在需要文档结构理解的任务中代表性不足，存在性能差距。

Method: 构建包含13个任务类别的多样化人工标注数据集，在零样本设置下评估专有和开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现优于开源模型，特别是在细粒度文本识别和手写内容提取任务中开源模型性能下降最明显。

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench为评估低资源、复杂脚本环境下的视觉语言模型提供了标准化框架，并识别了语言偏见、结构不匹配和幻觉内容等关键挑战。

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH是一个新的表格推理基准测试，包含7966个问题，来自2031个真实世界表格，涵盖科学和体育两个领域，旨在评估LLMs在复杂、异构表格上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格推理基准测试主要使用小型、统一的表格，无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性，也无法全面评估LLMs的推理能力。真实表格通常较长、异构且领域特定，需要跨数千个token进行多跳推理。

Method: 引入RUST-BENCH基准测试，包含来自NSF资助记录的科学领域和NBA统计数据的体育领域的真实表格，评估LLMs在规模、异构性、领域特异性和推理复杂性方面的综合能力。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在处理异构模式和复杂多跳推理时都存在困难，揭示了当前架构和提示策略的持续弱点。

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH为推进表格推理研究建立了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台。

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

Motivation: 基于对提示式文本简化方法的分析，发现文本简化性能与源CEFR级别和目标CEFR级别之间的差距高度相关，这启发了多轮简化方法的设计。

Method: 提出了两种多轮简化方法：基于规则的多轮简化（MRS-Rule）和联合规则与LLM的多轮简化（MRS-Joint），均使用GPT-4o生成简化文本。

Result: 提交的系统在20个团队中排名第7。后续改进显示，以LLM简化候选文本为起点可以进一步提升多轮简化性能。

Conclusion: 多轮简化方法在可读性控制的文本简化任务中表现良好，特别是结合LLM简化作为起点的策略能有效提升性能。

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人类中心应用中的普及，理解其类似人格的行为模式对于负责任的发展和部署变得越来越重要。

Method: 应用Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2)框架评估六个LLM在不同采样温度下的人格特质表达，使用层次聚类分析模型特征。

Result: 发现五个维度中有四个存在显著差异，神经质和外向性对温度调整敏感；层次聚类显示模型形成不同簇群，表明架构特征可能导致某些模型具有稳定的人格特征。

Conclusion: 这些结果为LLM中类似人格模式的出现提供了新见解，为模型调优、选择和AI系统伦理治理提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告对临床决策至关重要，但包含两种不确定性：显性不确定性（通过模糊表达反映对发现存在与否的怀疑）和隐性不确定性（由于省略推理过程导致的不确定性），现有基于规则的系统无法有效量化这些不确定性。

Method: 1) 通过专家验证的LLM参考排名量化显性不确定性，将每个发现映射到概率值；2) 通过扩展框架建模隐性不确定性，基于专家定义的14种常见诊断路径系统地添加特征性子发现。

Result: 发布了Lunguage++，这是Lunguage细粒度结构化放射学报告基准的扩展版本，具有不确定性感知能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现不确定性感知的图像分类、忠实的诊断推理，并为研究诊断不确定性的临床影响提供了新工具。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在生成文本时是否表示其可能采取的不同推理路径，以解决不确定性难以量化的问题。

Method: 使用隐藏激活来控制语言模型的不确定性，并在思维链推理过程中预测其未来结果分布。

Result: 发现模型不确定性与其可被激活控制引导的程度存在明显相关性，且隐藏激活能够预测模型的未来结果分布。

Conclusion: 语言模型隐式表示可能的推理路径空间，激活干预在模型尚未确定最终答案时最为有效。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文研究了隐式Langevin蒙特卡洛方法，该方法通过隐式迭代规则模拟过阻尼Langevin方程。相比显式方法，iLMC在漂移项仅满足单边Lipschitz条件时仍能保证收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式Langevin蒙特卡洛方法在漂移项不满足全局Lipschitz条件时可能发散，而iLMC方法在更弱的单边Lipschitz条件下仍能保证收敛，这在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Method: 采用连续时间插值方法，通过PDE技术（包括Bernstein方法）获得对数数值密度的梯度估计，并基于反射型连续-离散耦合方法证明几何遍历性。

Result: 证明了iLMC在相对熵下的时间离散化误差界，以及在Wasserstein-1距离下的几何遍历性，并将误差界扩展为一致时间误差界。

Conclusion: iLMC方法在非Lipschitz漂移项的随机微分方程模拟中具有优越性，证明技术具有普适性，可应用于其他隐式或分裂格式。

Abstract: We study the implicit Langevin Monte Carlo (iLMC) method, which simulates the
overdamped Langevin equation via an implicit iteration rule. In many
applications, iLMC is favored over other explicit schemes such as the
(explicit) Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). LMC may blow up when the drift field
$\nabla U$ is not globally Lipschitz, while iLMC has convergence guarantee when
the drift is only one-sided Lipschitz. Starting from an adapted continuous-time
interpolation, we prove a time-discretization error bound under the relative
entropy (or the Kullback-Leibler divergence), where a crucial gradient estimate
for the logarithm numerical density is obtained via a sequence of PDE
techniques, including Bernstein method. Based on a reflection-type
continuous-discrete coupling method, we prove the geometric ergodicity of iLMC
under the Wasserstein-1 distance. Moreover, we extend the error bound to a
uniform-in-time one by combining the relative entropy error bound and the
ergodicity. Our proof technique is universal and can be applied to other
implicit or splitting schemes for simulating stochastic differential equations
with non-Lipschitz drifts.

Abstract: We present a strategy for interpreting nonlinear, characteristic-type penalty
terms as numerical boundary flux functions that provide provable bounds for
solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic initial boundary value problems with open
boundaries. This approach is enabled by recent work that found how to express
the entropy flux as a quadratic form defined by a symmetric boundary matrix.
The matrix formulation provides additional information for how to
systematically design characteristic-based penalty terms for the weak
enforcement of boundary conditions. A special decomposition of the boundary
matrix is required to define an appropriate set of characteristic-type
variables. The new boundary fluxes are directly compatible with high-order
accurate split form discontinuous Galerkin spectral element and similar methods
and guarantee that the solution is entropy stable and bounded solely by
external data. We derive inflow-outflow boundary fluxes specifically for the
Burgers equation and the two-dimensional shallow water equations, which are
also energy stable. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new nonlinear
fluxes do not fail in situations where standard boundary treatments based on
linear analysis do.

Motivation: 张量列车分解虽然能处理高维问题，但无法内在保证单位范数约束，而单位范数张量在科学计算和量子物理中非常重要，因此需要一种能保持单位范数结构的低秩张量格式。

Conclusion: NTT分解不仅节省存储和计算成本，还能保持基础的单位范数结构，为张量恢复、高维特征值问题等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensors with unit Frobenius norm are fundamental objects in many fields,
including scientific computing and quantum physics, which are able to represent
normalized eigenvectors and pure quantum states. While the tensor train
decomposition provides a powerful low-rank format for tackling high-dimensional
problems, it does not intrinsically enforce the unit-norm constraint. To
address this, we introduce the normalized tensor train (NTT) decomposition,
which aims to approximate a tensor by unit-norm tensors in tensor train format.
The low-rank structure of NTT decomposition not only saves storage and
computational cost but also preserves the underlying unit-norm structure. We
prove that the set of fixed-rank NTT tensors forms a smooth manifold, and the
corresponding Riemannian geometry is derived, paving the way for geometric
methods. We propose NTT-based methods for low-rank tensor recovery,
high-dimensional eigenvalue problem, estimation of stabilizer rank, and
calculation of the minimum output R\'enyi 2-entropy of quantum channels.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and scalability of
the proposed NTT-based methods.

Motivation: 研究不同数值方法在解决第3和第4Zolotarev问题中的函数逼近性能，特别是比较传统AAA算法与其变体以及Loewner框架的效果。

Method: 使用Loewner框架、标准AAA算法、AAA符号变体和AAA-Lawson变体等多种方法进行数值实验比较。

Result: Loewner框架计算速度快、可靠性高，提供高精度逼近解；对于高次逼近，Loewner逼近比AAA-Lawson计算的近最优解更准确；Loewner运行时间恒定，而AAA-Lawson随逼近次数增加而显著增加。

Conclusion: Loewner框架是解决Zolotarev问题函数逼近的有效直接方法，在计算效率和精度方面优于迭代的AAA-Lawson变体。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a numerical study concerning the approximation of
functions associated with the 3rd and 4th Zolotarev problems. We compare
various methods, in particular the Loewner framework, the standard AAA
algorithm, and recently-proposed extensions of AAA (namely, the sign and Lawson
variants). We show that the Loewner framework is fast and reliable, and
provides approximants with a high level of accuracy. When the approximants are
of a higher degree, Loewner approximants are often more accurate than
near-optimal ones computed with AAA-Lawson. Last but not least, the Loewner
framework is a direct method for which the running time is typically lower than
that of the iterative AAA-Lawson variants. Moreover, for the latter, the
running time increases substantially with the degree of the approximant,
whereas for the Loewner method, it remains constant. These claims are supported
by an extensive numerical treatment.

Conclusion: 理论分析为选择mini-batch SG-UBU和SVRG-UBU采样器提供了实用的经验准则，以实现最优计算效率。数值实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: This paper considers mean square error (MSE) analysis for stochastic gradient
sampling algorithms applied to underdamped Langevin dynamics under a global
convexity assumption. A novel discrete Poisson equation framework is developed
to bound the time-averaged sampling error. For the Stochastic Gradient UBU
(SG-UBU) sampler, we derive an explicit MSE bound and establish that the
numerical bias exhibits first-order convergence with respect to the step size
$h$, with the leading error coefficient proportional to the variance of the
stochastic gradient. The analysis is further extended to variance-reduced
algorithms for finite-sum potentials, specifically the SVRG-UBU and SAGA-UBU
methods. For these algorithms, we identify a phase transition phenomenon
whereby the convergence rate of the numerical bias shifts from first to second
order as the step size decreases below a critical threshold. Theoretical
findings are validated by numerical experiments. In addition, the analysis
provides a practical empirical criterion for selecting between the mini-batch
SG-UBU and SVRG-UBU samplers to achieve optimal computational efficiency.

Abstract: This manuscript presents an efficient boundary integral equation technique
for solving two-dimensional Helmholtz problems defined in the half-plane
bounded by an infinite, periodic curve with Neumann boundary conditions and an
aperiodic point source. The technique is designed for boundaries where one
period does not require a large number of discretization points to achieve high
accuracy. The Floquet--Bloch transform turns the problem into evaluating a
contour integral where the integrand is the solution of quasiperiodic boundary
value problems. To approximate the integral, one must solve a collection of
these problems. This manuscript uses a variant of the periodizing scheme by Cho
and Barnett which alleviates the need for evaluating the quasiperiodic Green's
function and is amenable to a large amount of precomputation that can be reused
for all of the necessary solves. The solution technique is accelerated by the
use of low rank linear algebra. The numerical results illustrate that the
presented method is 20-30 faster than the technique utilizing the quasiperiodic
Green's function for a stair-like geometry.

Motivation: 亥姆霍兹问题的有限元方法在处理复杂几何和异质介质时有效，但产生的线性系统通常是大规模、不定且难以迭代求解的，特别是在高波数或接近共振条件下。需要深入理解GMRES收敛机制并改进求解策略。

Conclusion: 通过调和Ritz值视角深入理解了GMRES收敛机制，准模相关小特征值对收敛有显著影响；区域分解结合特征向量紧缩技术是改善亥姆霍兹问题求解性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Finite element methods are effective for Helmholtz problems involving complex
geometries and heterogeneous media. However, the resulting linear systems are
often large, indefinite, and challenging for iterative solvers, particularly at
high wave numbers or near resonant conditions. We derive a GMRES convergence
bound that incorporates the nonlinear behavior of the relative residual and
relates convergence to harmonic Ritz values. This perspective reveals how small
eigenvalues associated with quasimodes can hinder convergence, and when they
cease to have an effect. These phenomena occur in domain decomposition, and we
illustrate them through numerical experiments. We also combine domain
decomposition methods with deflation techniques using (approximate)
eigenvectors tailored to resonant regimes. Their impact on GMRES performance is
evaluated.

Method: 推导了V循环相对有限精度误差的界限，研究了基于不完全Cholesky分解的平滑方法，使用MATLAB Advanpix工具箱进行模拟浮点运算实验，并在GPU上使用Ginkgo库进行实验。

Result: 实验表明在特定设置下，IC平滑可以使用比残差、限制、延拓和校正操作更低的精度，相比统一双精度变体实现了最高1.43倍加速和71%能耗节省。

Abstract: Multigrid methods are popular iterative methods for solving large-scale
sparse systems of linear equations. We present a mixed precision formulation of
the multigrid V-cycle with general assumptions on the finite precision errors
coming from the application of coarsest-level solver and smoothing. Inspired by
existing analysis, we derive a bound on the relative finite precision error of
the V-cycle which gives insight into how the finite precision errors from the
individual components of the method may affect the overall finite precision
error. We use the result to study V-cycle methods with smoothing based on
incomplete Cholesky factorization. The results imply that in certain settings
the precisions used for applying the IC smoothing can be significantly lower
than the precision used for computing the residual, restriction, prolongation
and correction on the concrete level. We perform numerical experiments using
simulated floating point arithmetic with the MATLAB Advanpix toolbox as well as
experiments computed on GPUs using the Ginkgo library. The experiments
illustrate the theoretical findings and show that in the considered settings
the IC smoothing can be applied in relatively low precisions, resulting in
significant speedups (up to 1.43x) and energy savings (down to 71%) in
comparison with the uniform double precision variant.

Motivation: 传统子群方法在处理U-238敏感基准时存在系统吸收偏差，这会降低反应性。这种偏差源于狭窄稀疏的共振结构和稀释引起的多重共线性问题，导致自屏蔽响应饱和和弱多普勒展宽。

Method: 将鲁棒估计与差分进化算法集成。鲁棒估计用于处理模型错误设定和数据污染，差分进化算法作为优化工具在鲁棒估计框架内获得约束解。

Conclusion: 通过边界影响和在RE-DE框架内强制执行可行性，提出的鲁棒子群方法提高了共振自屏蔽处理的准确性和预测保真度。

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the subgroup method for resonance
self-shielding treatment, termed the robust subgroup method, which integrates
Robust Estimation (RE) with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The RE
approach is employed to handle model misspecification and data contamination,
while the DE algorithm serves as an optimization tool within the RE framework
to obtain constrained solutions. Numerical validation against experimental
benchmarks shows that the proposed method removes a systematic absorption bias
in conventional subgroup fits that would otherwise depress reactivity. This
bias appears only in benchmarks sensitive to U-238. Mechanistically, it
reflects a threshold-like conditioning failure: strong self-shielding leverage
dominates the loss and is magnified by dilution-induced multicollinearity. This
adverse conditioning appears to be seeded by a narrow, sparse resonance
structure at low energies in fertile even-even nuclides, thereby causing rapid
self-shielding response saturation and a weak Doppler broadening. By bounding
influence and enforcing feasibility within an RE-DE framework, the inferred
subgroup parameters track the underlying physics more faithfully, improving the
predictive fidelity of subsequent transport simulations.

Abstract: Accurate thermal analysis is crucial for modern spacecraft, driving demand
for reliable modeling tools. This research advances space thermal modeling by
improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer,
the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate
diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative
exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained
via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate
statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot
simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research
addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a
least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small
positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm.
To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also
introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection
between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A
simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error
(MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the
iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and
computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse
reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\circ}C$,
reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work
introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating
diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling
multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and
robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.

Abstract: Efficient identification of promising drug candidates for nanomaterial-based
delivery systems is essential for advancing next-generation therapeutics. In
this work, we present a synergistic framework combining density functional
theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to explore the adsorption behavior and
electronic interactions of drugs on a novel 2D graphene allotrope, termed
Graphsene (GrS). Graphsene, characterized by its porous ring topology and large
surface area, offers an excellent platform for efficient adsorption and strong
electronic coupling with drug molecules. A dataset comprising 67 drugs adsorbed
on various 2D substrates was employed to train the ML model, which was
subsequently applied to predict suitable drug candidates for GrS based on
molecular size and adsorption energy criteria (database link provided in a
later section). The ML model exhibited robust predictive accuracy, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.075 eV upon DFT validation, though its sensitivity to
initialization highlighted the need for larger and more diverse datasets.
DFT-based analyses, including adsorption energetics, projected density of
states (PDOS), and Bader charge calculations, revealed pronounced charge
transfer and electronic coupling between the drug molecules and the GrS
surface, elucidating the fundamental nature of drug-substrate interactions. The
study reveals that the integrated DFT-ML strategy offers a rapid,
cost-efficient approach for screening and understanding drug-nanomaterial
interactions, paving the way for data-driven design of advanced

Motivation: EIRENE作为聚变社区广泛使用的蒙特卡洛中性输运求解器，缺乏域分解功能，导致无法处理网格数据超过单个计算节点内存容量的模拟。

Method: 在新开源蒙特卡洛代码Eiron中实现了域分解蒙特卡洛算法，并与EIRENE现有的两种并行算法进行了比较，通过强扩展和弱扩展测试评估性能。

Conclusion: 在EIRENE中实现域分解算法将显著提升性能，并使得目前因内存限制而无法进行的模拟成为可能。

Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the
fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it
impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one
compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte
Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code,
Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in
Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests,
with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases.
On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids
that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also
scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency
of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a
low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this
domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable
simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential
equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such
as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that
characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding
and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in
PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as
a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models.
For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small
discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to
the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven
model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically
meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and
analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML.
We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our
framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is
possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate
the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.

Result: 对于弱到中等非谐波系统，H-PIMC将接受率提高6-16倍，自相关时间降低7-30倍，且需要更少的虚时间切片；M-PIMC适用于强非谐波系统，可优化自相关时间。

Conclusion: H-PIMC和M-PIMC算法显著提高了PIMC在量子凝聚相研究中的效率，特别是对于固体和致密液体系统，并能与蠕虫算法结合用于不可区分粒子系统。

Abstract: We propose an improved Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm called
Harmonic PIMC (H-PIMC) and its generalization, Mixed PIMC (M-PIMC). PIMC is a
powerful tool for studying quantum condensed phases. However, it often suffers
from a low acceptance ratio for solids and dense confined liquids. We develop
two sampling schemes especially suited for such problems by dividing the
potential into its harmonic and anharmonic contributions. In H-PIMC, we
generate the imaginary time paths for the harmonic part of the potential
exactly and accept or reject it based on the anharmonic part. In M-PIMC, we
restrict the harmonic sampling to the vicinity of local minimum and use
standard PIMC otherwise, to optimize efficiency. We benchmark H-PIMC on systems
with increasing anharmonicity, improving the acceptance ratio and lowering the
auto-correlation time. For weakly to moderately anharmonic systems, at $\beta
\hbar \omega=16$, H-PIMC improves the acceptance ratio by a factor of 6-16 and
reduces the autocorrelation time by a factor of 7-30. We also find that the
method requires a smaller number of imaginary time slices for convergence,
which leads to another two- to four-fold acceleration. For strongly anharmonic
systems, M-PIMC converges with a similar number of imaginary time slices as
standard PIMC, but allows the optimization of the auto-correlation time. We
extend M-PIMC to periodic systems and apply it to a sinusoidal potential.
Finally, we combine H- and M-PIMC with the worm algorithm, allowing us to
obtain similar efficiency gains for systems of indistinguishable particles.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文通过79-GHz FMCW信道测量，揭示了单静态和双静态感知信道在动态城市微小区环境中的相关性特征：瞬时相关性低但具有统一的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信道模型缺乏对ISAC特定动态的全面表征，特别是单静态和双静态感知配置之间的关系，需要实证测量来填补这一空白。

Method: 在动态城市微小区环境中使用79-GHz FMCW信道测量仪进行实证测量，涵盖七个真实场景，包括移动目标和收发器。

Result: 发现单静态和双静态信道由于传播几何差异而表现出持续低的瞬时相关性，但两者共享统一的时间一致性，在环境运动学下可预测地演化。

Conclusion: 这些见解为稳健的ISAC系统设计和未来标准化提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is critical for efficient
spectrum and hardware utilization in future wireless networks like 6G. However,
existing channel models lack comprehensive characterization of ISAC-specific
dynamics, particularly the relationship between mono-static (co-located Tx/Rx)
and bi-static (separated Tx/Rx) sensing configurations. Empirical measurements
in dynamic urban microcell (UMi) environments using a 79-GHz FMCW channel
sounder help bridge this gap. Two key findings are demonstrated: (1)
mono-static and bi-static channels exhibit consistently low instantaneous
correlation due to divergent propagation geometries; (2) despite low
instantaneous correlation, both channels share unified temporal consistency,
evolving predictably under environmental kinematics. These insights, validated
across seven real-world scenarios with moving targets/transceivers, inform
robust ISAC system design and future standardization.

Motivation: 传统快速变化检测算法需要显式的变化前和变化后分布来计算观测值的似然比，这对于高维数据和复杂机器学习模型计算成本高昂甚至不可行。

Method: 提出了min-SCUSUM方法，使用Hyvarinen分数代替对数似然比，计算分数函数的差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维数据和复杂模型中的快速变化检测提供了一种可行的替代方案，避免了传统似然比计算的困难。

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to multi-stream quickest change detection
and fault isolation for unnormalized and score-based statistical models.
Traditional optimal algorithms in the quickest change detection literature
require explicit pre-change and post-change distributions to calculate the
likelihood ratio of the observations, which can be computationally expensive
for higher-dimensional data and sometimes even infeasible for complex machine
learning models. To address these challenges, we propose the min-SCUSUM method,
a Hyvarinen score-based algorithm that computes the difference of score
functions in place of log-likelihood ratios. We provide a delay and false alarm
analysis of the proposed algorithm, showing that its asymptotic performance
depends on the Fisher divergence between the pre- and post-change
distributions. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound on the probability of
fault misidentification in distinguishing the affected stream from the
unaffected ones.

Conclusion: 可移动天线辅助的低地球轨道卫星集成感知与通信系统能显著提升感知性能，同时保持良好的通信性能。

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-assisted integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems have been extensively studied to achieve
ubiquitous connectivity. However, the severe signal attenuation and limited
transmit power at LEO satellites can degrade ISAC performance. To address this
issue, this paper investigated movable antenna (MA)-assisted LEO ISAC systems.
We derive the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and
the sensing squared position error bound (SPEB) for evaluating the ISAC
performance. Then, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the MA
positions to minimize the SPEB under the SINR constraints, total transmit power
constraint, and several inherent physical constraints of the MA array. We first
simplify the complex problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we
present a novel alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to decouple the
original problem into two subproblems, consequently convexified and solved.
Simulations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. Better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and
at least 25% gain in sensing performance are achieved, compared to the
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS辅助系统大多假设用户位置已知，但实际部署前通常只知道用户密度分布和障碍物配置。因此需要开发在用户随机性下的RIS位置优化方法。

Method: 提出递归粗到细方法：基于障碍物配置构建候选位置集，通过多次用户分布实例评估，在每阶段识别最优区域并递归细化搜索，最终确定RIS部署的最优区域。

Result: 数值结果验证了所提方法的有效性，能够在用户位置不确定的情况下优化RIS放置位置。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际RIS系统部署提供了有效的解决方案，能够在用户随机性下优化系统性能。

Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of
the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or
simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the
beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location
of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only
the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to
be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex
problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user
randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after
deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine
methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement
based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple
instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined
within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final
optimal region for RIS deployment. Numerical results are presented to
corroborate our findings.

Abstract: The massive scale of Wireless Foundation Models (FMs) hinders their real-time

distillation by introducing a novel Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (MCAKD) framework. Key innovations include a Cross-Attention-Based
Knowledge Selection (CA-KS) module that selectively identifies critical

achieve high training efficiency at a manageable computational cost. When
applied to the WiFo FM, the distilled Tiny-WiFo model, with only 5.5M
parameters, achieves a 1.6 ms inference time on edge hardware while retaining
over 98% of WiFo's performance and its crucial zero-shot generalization
capability, making real-time FM deployment viable.

*Yuanhan Ni,Fan Liu,Haoran Yin,Yanqun Tang,Zulin Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了用于集成感知与通信（ISAC）的仿射频分复用（AFDM）波形在脉冲整形下的模糊函数特性，推导了闭式表达式，比较了AFDM、OFDM和OCDM波形的性能，并提出通过调整参数c1来优化弱目标检测性能的设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AFDM波形在ISAC应用中的模糊函数特性，特别是脉冲整形对性能的影响，以解决强目标对弱目标检测的干扰问题。

Method: 首先推导无脉冲整形AFDM波形的平均平方离散周期模糊函数闭式表达式，然后综合分析AFDM、OFDM和OCDM波形的模糊函数特性，最后推导脉冲整形随机AFDM波形的闭式表达式。

Result: 发现三种波形在模糊函数旁瓣中具有相同数量的规则凹陷，但AFDM可通过调整参数c1灵活控制凹陷位置，脉冲整形滤波器在延迟轴产生成形主瓣，在多普勒轴产生快速滚降旁瓣。

Conclusion: AFDM波形参数可设计以减轻强目标凹陷对弱目标的不利影响，数值结果验证了理论分析和所提设计方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ambiguity function (AF) of the emerging affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform for Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) signaling under a pulse shaping regime. Specifically, we
first derive the closed-form expression of the average squared discrete period
AF (DPAF) for AFDM waveform without pulse shaping, revealing that the AF
depends on the parameter $c_1$ and the kurtosis of random communication data,
while being independent of the parameter $c_2$. As a step further, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis on the AFs of various waveforms, including AFDM,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp-division
multiplexing (OCDM). Our results indicate that all three waveforms exhibit the
same number of regular depressions in the sidelobes of their AFs, which incurs
performance loss for detecting and estimating weak targets. However, the AFDM
waveform can flexibly control the positions of depressions by adjusting the
parameter $c_1$, which motivates a novel design approach of the AFDM parameters
to mitigate the adverse impact of depressions of the strong target on the weak
target. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of the average squared DPAF for
pulse-shaped random AFDM waveform is derived, which demonstrates that the pulse
shaping filter generates the shaped mainlobe along the delay axis and the rapid
roll-off sidelobes along the Doppler axis. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed design methodology for
the AFDM modulation.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用L波段干涉时间序列数据和深度学习模型进行高分辨率森林制图的潜力，通过多种UNet架构和不同极化/干涉特征组合，显著提高了森林高度反演精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用L波段SAR干涉时间序列数据和深度学习技术来提高森林制图的精度和效率，为NISAR和未来ROSE-L任务提供可行方案。

Method: 使用ALOS-2 PALSAR-2双极化SAR图像时间序列，结合多种UNet架构（包括Vanilla UNet、SeU-Net和嵌套结构UNet），测试不同极化/干涉特征组合，并与机载激光扫描参考数据对比。

Result: 添加模型反演InSAR特征或InSAR相干层显著提高了反演精度。在20米分辨率下，仅使用强度数据的森林高度反演精度为3.1-3.8米，加入干涉相干特征后提高到2.8米以下。在60米分辨率下，最佳RMSE达到1.95米。

Conclusion: 注意力机制和嵌套连接融合提供了比传统方法更好的预测效果，推荐这种混合方法用于L波段SAR反演，适用于NISAR和未来ROSE-L任务。

Abstract: In this study, we examine the potential of high-resolution forest mapping
using L-band interferometric time series datasets and deep learning modeling.
Our SAR data are represented by a time series of nine ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dual-pol
SAR images acquired at near-zero spatial baseline over a study site in
Asturias, Northern Spain. Reference data are collected using airborne laser
scanning. We examine the performance of several candidate deep learning models
from UNet-family with various combinations of input polarimetric and
interferometric features. In addition to basic Vanilla UNet, attention
reinforced UNet model with squeeze-excitation blocks (SeU-Net) and advanced
UNet model with nested structure and skip pathways are used. Studied features
include dual pol interferometric observables additionally incorporating
model-based derived measures. Results show that adding model-based inverted
InSAR features or InSAR coherence layers improves retrieval accuracy compared
to using backscatter intensity only. Use of attention mechanisms and nested
connection fusion provides better predictions than using Vanilla UNet or
traditional machine learning methods. Forest height retrieval accuracies range
between 3.1-3.8 m (R2 = 0.45--0.55) at 20 m resolution when only intensity data
are used, and improve to less than 2.8 m when both intensity and
interferometric coherence features are included. At 40 m and 60 m resolution,
retrieval performance further improves, primarily due to higher SNR in both the
intensity and interferometric layers. When using intensity at 60 m resolution,
best achieved RMSE is 2.2 m, while when using all suitable input features the
achieved error is 1.95 m. We recommend this hybrid approach for L-band SAR
retrievals also suitable for NISAR and future ROSE-L missions.

Abstract: This paper presents a switch-type attenuator working from 20 to 100 GHz. The
attenuator adopts a capacitive compensation technique to reduce phase error.
The small resistors in this work are implemented with metal lines to reduce the
intrinsic parasitic ca?pacitance, which helps minimize the amplitude and phase
errors over a wide frequency range. Moreover, the utilization of metal lines
also reduces the chip area. In addition, a continuous tuning attenuation unit
is employed to improve the overall attenuation accuracy of the attenuator. The
passive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm CMOS. The
measurement results reveal a relative attenuation range of 7.5 dB with a
continuous tuning step within 20-100 GHz. The insertion loss is 1.6-3.8 dB
within the operation band, while the return losses of all states are better
than 11.5 dB. The RMS amplitude and phase errors are below 0.15 dB and
1.6{\deg}, respectively.

Motivation: 深度生成模型特别是扩散架构在图像生成方面取得了突破，但难以控制和优化特定目标而不需要昂贵的重新训练。嵌入空间探索，尤其是使用进化算法，被证明是优化图像生成的有前景方法。

Method: 使用可分离协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(sep-CMA-ES)与自适应矩估计(Adam)优化Stable Diffusion XL Turbo的提示嵌入向量，评估图像时结合LAION美学预测器V2和CLIPScore构建加权适应度函数。

Result: 在Parti Prompts(P2)数据集子集上的实验表明，sep-CMA-ES在美学和对齐指标上持续产生优于Adam的改进。

Conclusion: 进化方法为扩散模型提供了高效的无梯度优化，无需微调即可增强可控性，强调了进化方法在深度生成模型嵌入空间探索中的潜力。

Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed
image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for
specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration,
especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising
method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models.
Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary
optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The
evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore
into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual
appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts
(P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements
in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that
the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for
diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning.
This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space
exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.

Conclusion: DreamGym为通用强化学习提供了可扩展的预热启动策略，通过合成经验有效解决了RL训练中的数据可扩展性问题，在合成设置和模拟到真实迁移场景中都显著提升了RL训练效果。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [118] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能源于双向关系建模的传统观点，证明DKT的真正优势在于其隐含建模先决条件因果结构的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清深度知识追踪(DKT)模型性能提升的真正原因，挑战其源于双向知识组件关系建模的流行解释。

Method: 通过将练习关系图修剪为有向无环图(DAG)，在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，并使用DKT学习表示提取练习关系DAG的替代方法。

Result: DKT的预测能力与因果结构高度一致，其学习表示可用于有效提取练习关系DAG，支持因果依赖关系是DKT有效性主要驱动因素的观点。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要源于其近似知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力，而非简单的双向关系映射。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [119] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文化价值观表示方面的局限性，发现提示语言和文化框架会影响模型输出，但无法克服模型对少数国家（荷兰、德国、美国、日本）价值观的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，需要评估这些模型是否能代表其多样化用户群体的文化多样性，特别是考虑到训练数据和优化目标中存在的已知不平衡问题。

Method: 使用霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查中的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，以带有和不带有明确文化视角的提示形式探测10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但所有测试模型都表现出对少数国家价值观的系统性偏见。明确的文视角比针对性提示语言更能提高与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：它们对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于锚定特定文化默认值而无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过开发博弈论实验的数字孪生和系统提示框架，评估LLMs对人类决策行为的模拟能力，发现Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，而Qwen更接近纳什均衡预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的匹配程度至关重要，因为不匹配可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复制人类行为会使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统提示和探测框架进行机器行为评估，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen）。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为；Qwen与纳什均衡预测紧密对齐；无需基于角色的提示即可实现群体级行为复制。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs可以复制人类行为模式，并系统探索未实验空间，为社会科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新经验预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多智能体AI系统中的异常检测任务，构建了两个包含4,275和894条轨迹的数据集，并比较了监督和半监督方法在检测漂移、循环和输出细节缺失等静默故障方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体AI系统具有非确定性特性，容易发生漂移、循环和输出细节缺失等难以检测的静默故障，需要系统化的异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了一个数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变化，并构建了两个基准数据集。使用XGBoost（监督）和SVDD（半监督）方法进行异常检测基准测试。

Result: 监督方法（XGBoost）和半监督方法（SVDD）表现相当，分别达到98%和96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究多智能体AI系统中异常检测的工作，提供了数据集、基准测试和见解，为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型中数字推理错误的底层表示机制，发现LLMs编码真实世界数字相关性但会系统性放大它们，无关上下文会导致幅度表示的一致偏移，揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录了大语言模型中的数字推理错误，但其底层表示机制仍不清楚。研究者假设数字属性占据共享的潜在子空间，并探究LLMs如何内部整合单个实体的多个数字属性，以及无关数字上下文如何干扰这些表示及其下游输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及在不同规模模型上进行基于提示的脆弱性测试。

Result: 结果显示LLMs编码真实世界的数字相关性但倾向于系统性放大它们。无关上下文会导致幅度表示的一致偏移，其下游影响因模型规模而异。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL是一个去中心化的神经符号框架，用于合作多智能体规划。它通过两阶段协商协议实现协作：智能体首先提出候选角色并推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配。承诺后，每个智能体独立生成并执行其角色的符号计划，无需透露详细轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合作多智能体规划需要在部分信息和有限通信下做出联合决策。轨迹级别的协调经常失败，因为时间或运动中的微小偏差会级联成冲突。符号规划通过提高抽象级别和提供最小动作词汇来缓解这一挑战，实现同步和集体进展。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：1）智能体提出候选角色并进行推理；2）在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配。承诺后，智能体独立生成符号计划并通过共享世界模型执行，该模型编码当前状态并随智能体行动更新。

Result: 在合作推块任务上的实验表明，智能体能够跨情景适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率。通过协商和自我优化，以时间开销为代价发展出更高效的协作策略。

Conclusion: 通过推理符号计划而非原始轨迹，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的更高级操作。神经符号方法在合作多智能体规划中展现出优势。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-KGFR协作框架，结合大语言模型和知识图谱基础检索器，解决LLM在知识密集型问题上的局限性，实现零样本泛化到未见图谱的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理方面表现出色，但在处理知识密集型问题时受限于上下文长度和参数化知识。现有方法依赖微调LLM或GNN检索器，存在数据集特定调优和在大型或未见图谱上可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: LLM-KGFR框架包含：1) KGFR使用LLM生成的关系描述编码关系，基于问题中的角色初始化实体；2) 非对称渐进传播(APP)方法逐步扩展，选择性限制高度节点同时保留信息路径；3) 通过节点、边和路径级接口，LLM迭代请求候选答案、支持事实和推理路径。

Result: 实验表明LLM-KGFR在保持可扩展性和泛化能力的同时实现了强大性能，为知识图谱增强推理提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR框架通过结构化检索器与LLM的协作，有效解决了知识密集型推理问题，具备零样本泛化能力和高效处理大型图谱的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Motivation: 需要一种系统化的方法来评估和优化工作流的质量和效率，特别是在现代自动化系统中，需要一个统一的框架来量化工作流的性能特征。

Method: 结合Opus工作流奖励（概率函数估计预期性能）和Opus工作流规范惩罚（测量结构和信息质量），形成一个统一的优化公式，支持自动评估、排序和优化。

Result: 提出了一个完整的数学框架，能够直接比较、评分和优化工作流，并可以集成到强化学习循环中指导工作流的发现和改进。

Conclusion: Opus工作流评估框架为工作流质量评估和优化提供了一个系统化的数学基础，支持在现代自动化系统中进行有效的工作流管理和改进。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中由于部分可观测性和有限带宽导致的空间记忆共享和协调失败问题。

Method: 采用信息瓶颈目标，让智能体学习通信的对象、内容和时机；基于网格细胞状度量的内部空间编码；分层强化学习策略主动探索减少联合不确定性。

Result: 在Memory-Maze基准测试中，带宽从128位/步降至4位/步时，成功率从73.5%优雅降至64.4%，而全广播基线从67.6%崩溃至28.6%。

Conclusion: 为复杂社会表征如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论原则和生物学上合理的基础，实现了社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证奖励训练中存在过拟合挑战，模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力，这由策略过度专业化和训练期间生成多样解决方案的灾难性遗忘驱动。

Method: RLoop基于迭代策略初始化构建，首先使用RL从给定策略探索解空间，然后过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)来改进初始策略，为下一次迭代创建更好的起点。

Result: 实验显示RLoop缓解了遗忘问题，显著改善泛化能力，相比原始RL平均准确率提升9%，pass@32指标提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过探索与利用的迭代重新初始化，有效将瞬态策略变化转化为稳健的性能增益，解决了强化学习中的过拟合和泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI中广泛使用探针准确率来评估概念激活向量(CAV)的概念对齐度，但作者发现这不可靠，因为探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非目标概念。

Method: 引入基于空间线性归因的概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行比较，并提出三类评估指标：硬准确率、分割分数和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现故意构建的错位探针也能达到接近标准探针的准确率，而具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针准确率，并且探针设计应考虑模型架构和目标概念的特性。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a

reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible

Motivation: 当前基于LLMs的医疗系统在药物安全方面的研究有限，缺乏真实世界数据集，且在真实临床咨询环境中的评估不足。

Method: 开发了模拟临床咨询的框架，生成包含药物风险的诊断对话，构建专门的药物安全数据库RxRisk DB，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业性。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs难以整合禁忌症和相互作用知识，特别是在风险暗示而非明确的情况下表现不佳。

Conclusion: RxSafeBench提供了首个全面的LLMs药物安全评估基准，为改进AI驱动的临床决策支持系统的可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven

### [131] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV)框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控机制来解决模型早期陷入次优推理路径的问题，将元认知理论转化为计算规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时推理架构缺乏监控过程，导致模型容易陷入前缀主导陷阱——早期就固定在次优推理路径上难以恢复，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell、Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，提出MGV框架，在生成前添加显式监控机制，捕获从难度评估到置信度判断的元认知体验，并通过验证反馈来优化未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统性地将基础元认知理论转化为计算规范，为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇。

Conclusion: MGV框架为未来测试时推理设计提供了具体的架构干预建议，通过整合元认知监控来改善推理系统的性能。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [132] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO是一种新的强化学习优化方法，解决了GRPO在使用序数奖励时对失败轨迹错误分配正优势的问题。它通过自适应基线确保失败解决方案永远不会被正向强化，并在达到质量阈值后自动切换到相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在适应LLMs执行特定任务时很受欢迎，但这种简单性在使用序数奖励提供部分信用时会产生问题，因为其组平均基线经常对失败轨迹分配正优势并强化错误行为。

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败的解决方案永远不会被正向强化。一旦策略持续满足此阈值，基线会自动过渡到相对偏好模式，推动模型寻找最优解决方案而不仅仅是"可接受"的解决方案。

Result: 在代码验证任务上的实证验证表明，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在使LLMs通过强化学习学习真正新能力的研究计划中的关键一步，通过让LLMs能够从丰富的多维反馈中学习，从二元奖励进展到序数奖励，最终实现更密集的每步监督。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

### [133] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义视为合作交互的特征而非缺陷，开发了一个区分可解析的合作查询与不可解析的非合作查询的框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视自然语言表格数据接口中的查询歧义问题，将其视为用户与系统之间合作交互的特征，而非需要修复的缺陷。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询和非合作查询，并将该框架应用于15个流行表格问答和分析数据集的查询分析。

Result: 发现现有数据集中的查询类型混合控制不当，既不适合评估系统执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析将视角从修复歧义转向在解析查询中拥抱合作，为自然语言表格数据接口的设计和评估提供了更明智的方向和未来研究建议。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于合理代表（JR）概念的审计框架，用于衡量专家问答环节中问题选择的代表性，并开发了高效的审计算法。通过比较人工选择、优化算法和LLM生成的问题，评估了不同方法在代表性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者只能向专家提出有限数量的问题，如何选择最具代表性的问题子集成为一个重要挑战。

Method: 引入基于合理代表（JR）概念的审计框架，开发了在通用效用设置下审计JR的首个算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)。

Result: 将审计方法应用于历史审议数据，比较了主持人选择的问题、整数线性规划优化的问题和LLM生成的问题在代表性方面的差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了LLM在支持审议过程中的潜力和当前局限性，通过将方法集成到在线审议平台，使实践者能够轻松审计和改进未来审议的代表性。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一种神经符号方法，通过将思维链推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，并利用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，从而识别和验证LLM推理中的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM虽然能通过思维链进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中削弱了可信度。

Method: VeriCoT从思维链推理中提取形式化逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，利用符号表示实现自动验证。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。

Conclusion: VeriCoT通过验证信号支持推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理的有效性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

*Adam M. Saunders,Michael E. Kim,Gaurav Rudravaram,Lucas W. Remedios,Chloe Cho,Elyssa M. McMaster,Daniel R. Gillis,Yihao Liu,Lianrui Zuo,Bennett A. Landman,Tonia S. Rex*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究利用FITBIR数据库的大规模多中心MRI数据，通过图像配准和区域体积分析，识别了创伤性脑损伤（TBI）患者与对照组在37个脑区中的显著体积差异，揭示了TBI损伤的三个主要模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创伤性脑损伤具有高度异质性，临床结果测量（如格拉斯哥昏迷量表）难以捕捉这种多样性。患者严重程度和预后的巨大变异性使得难以将结构损伤与功能缺陷联系起来。

Method: 使用FITBIR数据库的25项研究、7,693个MRI会话数据，首先将T1加权图像配准到本地数据集，分割132个感兴趣区域（ROI），进行质量控制后计算区域体积，使用z-score标准化，并通过多元线性回归校正性别、年龄和总脑体积的影响。

Result: 发现TBI患者与对照组在37个ROI中存在显著差异（p < 0.05，经FDR校正）。通过独立成分分析和聚类分析，识别出TBI损伤的三个主要起源：1）脑干、枕极和眶后结构；2）皮层下灰质和岛叶皮层；3）大脑和小脑白质。

Conclusion: 该研究成功揭示了TBI的共享损伤通路，为理解TBI的异质性提供了重要的神经影像学证据，有助于改进TBI的诊断和治疗策略。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is intrinsically heterogeneous, and typical
clinical outcome measures like the Glasgow Coma Scale complicate this
diversity. The large variability in severity and patient outcomes render it
difficult to link structural damage to functional deficits. The Federal
Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) repository contains
large-scale multi-site magnetic resonance imaging data of varying resolutions
and acquisition parameters (25 shared studies with 7,693 sessions that have
age, sex and TBI status defined - 5,811 TBI and 1,882 controls). To reveal
shared pathways of injury of TBI through imaging, we analyzed T1-weighted
images from these sessions by first harmonizing to a local dataset and
segmenting 132 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain. After running quality
assurance, calculating the volumes of the ROIs, and removing outliers, we
calculated the z-scores of volumes for all participants relative to the mean
and standard deviation of the controls. We regressed out sex, age, and total
brain volume with a multivariate linear regression, and we found significant
differences in 37 ROIs between subjects with TBI and controls (p < 0.05 with
independent t-tests with false discovery rate correction). We found that
differences originated in 1) the brainstem, occipital pole and structures
posterior to the orbit, 2) subcortical gray matter and insular cortex, and 3)
cerebral and cerebellar white matter using independent component analysis and
clustering the component loadings of those with TBI.

### [137] [Climbing the label tree: Hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning for medical imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03771)
*Alif Elham Khan*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持层次结构的对比学习框架，将医学图像标签的树状结构作为训练信号和评估目标，通过层次加权对比和层级感知边界两个目标函数提升表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标签通常按层次结构组织（如器官-组织-亚型），但标准的自监督学习忽略了这种结构信息。

Method: 引入层次加权对比（HWC）和层级感知边界（LAM）两个可插拔目标函数，HWC通过共享祖先缩放正负对强度促进同父级内聚性，LAM通过原型边界在不同层级分离祖先组。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法相比强基线自监督学习方法持续提升表示质量，同时更好地保持了标签层次结构，在层次忠实度指标（HF1、H-Acc等）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单通用的方案，用于学习尊重标签层次结构的医学图像表示，在层次丰富的领域中同时提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CORE的从粗到细的框架，用于多模态全切片图像（WSI）的精确核级配准，包括粗配准、细粒度刚性配准和细胞级非刚性对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像的精确高效配准对于多染色组织切片的高分辨率、核级分析至关重要，需要解决多模态WSI数据集的核级配准问题。

Method: 采用从粗到细的三阶段方法：1）粗配准阶段使用提示式组织掩模提取过滤伪影，通过组织形态学和预训练特征提取器进行全局对齐；2）细粒度刚性配准使用形状感知点集配准模型；3）使用相干点漂移（CPD）进行细胞级非刚性对齐。

Result: 在三个公开WSI配准数据集和两个私有数据集上评估，CORE在明场和免疫荧光显微镜WSI中，在泛化性、精度和鲁棒性方面优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: CORE框架通过自动生成的核增强了可变形配准的准确性，确保跨模态的精确核级对应，为多模态WSI分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential
for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We
propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level
registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The
coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to
effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global
alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with
a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei
centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a
custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment
at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement
field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from
automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable
registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across
modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI
registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and
robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs

Abstract: The turn of the millennium has seen a growing interest in the study of live
cells by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, driven by the versatility, wealth of
molecular information, and potential for high-throughput screening of the
technique. Measurements on individual cells, either isolated or within a
multi-cellular structure, provide information that is not available from
ensemble samples. The present review discusses the use of infrared (IR)
microscopy to analyse live single cells from a biochemical perspective, seeking
information on real-time processes. The emphasis is on the use of the technique
to quantify metabolic turnover, with the aim of providing a complementary
method for metabolomics, and for toxicological and pharmacological studies. The
present work highlights the methodological advances and proof-of-concept
experiments that took place over the past few years in this direction. It
discusses current advantages and limitations of the technique, including the
possibility of detecting specific biomolecules and their reactivity, and it
concludes with a brief outline of future perspectives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用变分自编码器(VAE)的生成建模框架，用于从目标摩擦定律推断表面形貌，解决了摩擦界面设计的逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有规定宏观行为的摩擦界面是一个具有挑战性的逆问题，传统方法依赖低维参数化的启发式搜索，限制了其在复杂或非线性摩擦定律中的适用性。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)构建生成模型，基于包含2亿个样本的合成数据集进行训练，这些样本来自参数化接触力学模型，实现了无仿真的高效候选形貌生成。

Result: 该方法能够高效、无仿真地生成候选表面形貌，研究探讨了生成建模在精度、吞吐量和解决方案多样性之间的平衡潜力与局限性。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过定制表面形貌实现摩擦行为的近实时控制铺平了道路，并突出了在平衡这些目标时的权衡和实际考虑。

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

TL;DR: 本文从控制论角度研究动态测度传输(DMT)中的测度路径识别问题，指出常用路径可能不适合DMT，并将现有学习替代路径的方法与平均场博弈联系起来，提出了一族灵活的优化问题来识别倾斜测度路径，并提倡使用促进速度平滑性的目标项。

Motivation: 现有DMT方法中常用的测度路径可能不是最优选择，需要开发更有效的路径识别方法来提高采样效率。

Method: 提出基于高斯过程求解偏微分方程的数值算法，用于解决倾斜测度路径的优化问题，特别强调速度平滑性目标项的使用。

Result: 与使用未倾斜参考路径的方法相比，本文方法能够恢复更高效和平滑的传输模型。

Conclusion: 从控制论视角提出的倾斜测度路径优化方法能够显著改善DMT的性能，获得更平滑高效的传输模型。

Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of
measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the
fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing
methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these
connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying
tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms
which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a
numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process
methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the
ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models
compared to those which use an untilted reference path.

Motivation: 为随机核矩阵的期望算子范数提供更简单、用户友好的边界，避免传统方法中复杂的矩方法和组合论证。

Method: 使用U统计量解耦结果和非交换Khintchine不等式，通过核函数的标量统计量和相关核矩阵来构建上下界。

Result: 获得了仅依赖于核函数标量统计量和相关核矩阵的上下界，为高维内积核矩阵提供了新的更紧近似，简化了现有结果的证明。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅简化了现有结果的证明，还提供了各向异性高斯数据情况下的新近似结果，并给出了核回归偏差的更紧下界。

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.

Motivation: 为严格比较在线SGD及其变体算法，特别是带Polyak动量的SGD-M，在高维设置下的性能差异，并研究自适应步长对算法稳定性的影响。

Method: 开发高维缩放极限理论框架，分析SGD-M和在线SGD的动力学行为，在张量PCA和单指标模型上进行实证验证，比较不同步长策略的效果。

Result: SGD-M在适当时间重缩放和特定步长下与在线SGD等价；若步长相同，SGD-M会放大高维效应；自适应步长算法具有更接近最优解的固定点，且收敛范围更广。

Conclusion: 早期预条件器可以在在线SGD失效的情况下稳定并改进算法动力学，自适应步长策略在高维学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

Result: 在受污染的高斯模型和四次势能模型上的实证结果表明，所提方法在鲁棒性和统计效率方面显著优于标准基线方法。

Conclusion: γ-Stein算子提供了一种原则性的鲁棒机制，能够有效降低异常值对推断结果的影响，在非归一化概率模型的鲁棒推断中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线保形推理方法，通过回顾性调整实现更快的分布漂移适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统保形预测在在线环境中面临分布漂移问题，现有方法只能前向更新预测，适应速度较慢

Method: 利用回归方法和高效留一更新公式，在新数据到达时回顾性调整过去预测，使所有预测与最新数据分布对齐

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛数值研究表明，该方法比现有在线保形预测方法实现更快的覆盖率重新校准和更高的统计效率

Conclusion: 所提出的回顾性调整方法能有效应对在线环境中的分布漂移问题，提供更快的适应速度和更好的统计性能

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

*Giovanni Barbarino,Nicolas Gillis,Subhayan Saha*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文证明了最小体积非负矩阵分解（min-vol NMF）在噪声条件下能够识别真实因子，前提是数据点在基向量生成的潜在单纯形中满足扩展充分散射条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小体积NMF已在多个领域成功应用，但其对噪声的鲁棒性一直是一个未解决的开放性问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明在扩展充分散射条件下，min-vol NMF能够识别噪声环境中的真实因子。

Result: 证明了min-vol NMF在满足扩展充分散射条件时，能够在噪声存在的情况下准确识别地面真实因子。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了min-vol NMF对噪声鲁棒性的长期开放问题，为其在噪声环境下的可靠应用提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GEORCE-FM算法，用于在黎曼流形上同时计算Fr\'echet均值和黎曼距离，相比现有方法更快，并扩展到Finsler流形和自适应扩展以处理大数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fr\'echet均值是几何统计中的核心概念，但现有计算方法需要在每次迭代中求解嵌入式优化问题，计算效率较低。

Method: 提出GEORCE-FM算法，在局部坐标系中同时计算Fr\'echet均值和黎曼距离，避免重复优化，并扩展到Finsler流形和自适应扩展。

Result: 理论证明GEORCE-FM具有全局收敛性和局部二次收敛性，自适应扩展在期望上收敛到Fr\'echet均值。实证表明在准确性和运行时间上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GEORCE-FM算法为计算Fr\'echet均值提供了更高效的方法，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This
is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum
of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points.
The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but
for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an
optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean
require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We
introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean
and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster
than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and
introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of
data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and
local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in
expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that
GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean
in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Riesz回归与直接密度比估计之间的关系，以便在特定情况下直接应用现有的密度比估计结果，同时扩展直接密度比估计方法的应用范围。

Method: 通过理论分析建立Riesz回归与直接密度比估计的等价关系，特别是在平均处理效应估计等案例中，利用最小二乘重要性拟合方法。

Result: 发现Riesz回归与直接密度比估计在重要案例中具有等价性，这使得可以直接导入密度比估计的现有结果，包括收敛率分析、损失函数选择和正则化技术。

Conclusion: Riesz回归与直接密度比估计的等价关系为两者提供了相互借鉴的理论基础和应用扩展，整合了先前的研究成果。

Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine
learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al.,
2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct
density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-
ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz
regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,
Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz
regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer
estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to
directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including
convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via
Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible
models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz
representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct
density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in
Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MazeMate是一个集成在3D迷宫编程游戏中的LLM驱动聊天机器人，旨在通过自适应、上下文相关的支架来培养计算思维。在247名本科生的课堂实施中，学生认为它中等有帮助，在迷宫解决方面比迷宫设计更有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算思维是基础的问题解决技能，虽然大型语言模型提供按需编程支持，但当前应用很少促进计算思维发展。需要设计能够培养计算思维的LLM应用。

Method: 开发MazeMate系统，这是一个嵌入3D迷宫编程游戏的LLM驱动聊天机器人，提供与迷宫解决和迷宫设计中的计算思维过程对齐的自适应、上下文相关支架。

Result: 247名本科生的课堂实施显示，学生认为MazeMate中等有帮助，迷宫解决的感知有用性高于迷宫设计。主题分析确认了对分解、抽象和算法思维等计算思维过程的支持，但也揭示了在支持迷宫设计方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的支架有支持计算思维的潜力，但需要设计改进来增强MazeMate在真实课堂中的可用性，特别是在迷宫设计支持方面。

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a foundational problem-solving skill, and
gamified programming environments are a widely adopted approach to cultivating
it. While large language models (LLMs) provide on-demand programming support,
current applications rarely foster CT development. We present MazeMate, an
LLM-powered chatbot embedded in a 3D Maze programming game, designed to deliver
adaptive, context-sensitive scaffolds aligned with CT processes in maze solving
and maze design. We report on the first classroom implementation with 247
undergraduates. Students rated MazeMate as moderately helpful, with higher
perceived usefulness for maze solving than for maze design. Thematic analysis
confirmed support for CT processes such as decomposition, abstraction, and
algorithmic thinking, while also revealing limitations in supporting maze
design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions.
These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based scaffolding to support CT
and underscore directions for design refinement to enhance MazeMate usability
in authentic classrooms.

Abstract: Large language models are moving beyond transactional question answering to
act as companions, coaches, mediators, and curators that scaffold human growth,
decision-making, and well-being. This paper proposes a role-based framework for
human-centered LLM support systems, compares real deployments across domains,
and identifies cross-cutting design principles: transparency, personalization,
guardrails, memory with privacy, and a balance of empathy and reliability. It
outlines evaluation metrics that extend beyond accuracy to trust, engagement,
and longitudinal outcomes. It also analyzes risks including over-reliance,
hallucination, bias, privacy exposure, and unequal access, and proposes future
directions spanning unified evaluation, hybrid human-AI models, memory
architectures, cross-domain benchmarking, and governance. The goal is to
support responsible integration of LLMs in sensitive settings where people need
accompaniment and guidance, not only answers.

*Joe Shymanski,Jacob Brue,Sandip Sen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文批评当前可解释人工智能(XAI)评估方法的局限性，指出任何解释都比没有解释更能提高用户满意度，强调需要更全面的评估技术来证明解释质量，并提出了可操作解释的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI评估方法缺乏通用性和系统性，大多数研究仅通过简单的用户调查比较有无解释的差异，无法充分证明解释的质量，因为任何解释都比没有解释更能提高用户满意度。

Method: 使用智能体助手教授国际象棋概念给用户，验证两个主张：大多数解释无论质量如何都会提高用户满意度，以及需要强调可操作的解释。

Result: 研究证实了作者的假设，即无论解释质量如何，用户满意度都会提高，同时证明了可操作解释的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁XAI领域开发更全面的评估技术，超越用户满意度来证明解释质量，并分析了安慰剂解释和可操作解释在不同场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to create transparency in
modern AI models by offering explanations of the models to human users. There
are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of
these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like
"fidelity". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best
and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple
user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those
generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate
evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe
any kind of explanation will be "better" in most metrics when compared to none
at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations,
regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also
propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We
demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to
teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call
to action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for
future research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction.
Additionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or
actionable explanations would be most useful.

Motivation: 为视障学生提供公平的计算机科学教育机会，改善非视觉代码导航、理解、编辑和调试能力，同时最小化认知负荷。

Method: 开发了一个非资源密集型的Web应用程序，支持JavaScript程序开发、执行和调试，通过电缆连接到带有六个触觉电机的Arduino驱动手套，提供物理反馈。

Result: 初步评估表明HACI有助于非视觉导航和理解编程结构，但在反馈机制的一致性和可靠性方面仍需改进，需要更丰富的功能和可定制的学习体验。

Conclusion: 触觉和音频反馈在视障教育实践中具有变革潜力，为未来可访问编程教育研究奠定了基础，展示了如何有效将触觉和听觉反馈整合到教育工具中，从而扩大STEM教育的可访问性。

Abstract: This thesis introduces the Haptic-Audio Code Interface (HACI), an educational
tool designed to enhance programming education for visually impaired (VI)
students by integrating haptic and audio feedback to compensate for the absence
of visual cues. HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application
supporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected
via a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to
provide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide
equitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve
non-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging
for students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work
details HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary
evaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science
students. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and
understanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining
feedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as
supplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and
customizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired
students to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study
underscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in
educational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for
future research and development in accessible programming education. This
thesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how
tactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational
tools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: SnappyMeal是一个基于多模态AI的饮食追踪系统，通过多种输入方式和智能追问来提高食物记录的灵活性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的食物记录方法（如手写和应用日志）缺乏灵活性，导致用户依从性低和营养总结不准确，需要改进的饮食追踪方法。

Method: 利用多模态输入，引入目标依赖的追问问题，从用户杂货收据和营养数据库中检索信息以提高准确性。

Result: 通过公开营养基准测试和3周实地部署（记录500多个食物实例），用户高度评价多种输入方法并报告感知准确性高。

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统可以显著提高饮食追踪的灵活性和情境感知能力，为智能自我追踪应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in
uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.
Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice
dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and
app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and
potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by
prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.
In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that
leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food
intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to
intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from
user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We
evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a
multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food
instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and
reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI
systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility
and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent
self-tracking applications.

Motivation: 研究人类-AI协作中，展示AI推理如何影响人类信任和独特人类知识（UHK）的运用，以改进人机协作系统的信息设计。

Method: 通过预注册、激励相容的实验（N=752），比较展示AI推理（简短或详细）对信任和UHK利用的影响。

Result: 展示AI推理作为强有力的说服启发式，显著增加信任和与AI建议的一致性，但导致过度信任并挤占UHK利用。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎考虑展示AI推理的方式，并为人机协作系统设计更好的信息呈现方案。

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration requires humans to accurately gauge AI
capabilities and calibrate their trust accordingly. Humans often have
context-dependent private information, referred to as Unique Human Knowledge
(UHK), that is crucial for deciding whether to accept or override AI's
recommendations. We examine how displaying AI reasoning affects trust and UHK
utilization through a pre-registered, incentive-compatible experiment (N =
752). We find that revealing AI reasoning, whether brief or extensive, acts as
a powerful persuasive heuristic that significantly increases trust and
agreement with AI recommendations. Rather than helping participants
appropriately calibrate their trust, this transparency induces over-trust that
crowds out UHK utilization. Our results highlight the need for careful
consideration when revealing AI reasoning and call for better information
design in human-AI collaboration systems.

Abstract: Preprinting has become a norm in fast-paced computing fields such as
artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI). In this
paper, we conducted semistructured interviews with 15 academics in these fields
to reveal their motivations and perceptions of preprinting. The results found a
close relationship between preprinting and characteristics of the fields,
including the huge number of papers, competitiveness in career advancement,
prevalence of scooping, and imperfect peer review system - preprinting comes to
the rescue in one way or another for the participants. Based on the results, we
reflect on the role of preprinting in subverting the traditional publication
mode and outline possibilities of a better publication ecosystem. Our study
contributes by inspecting the community aspects of preprinting practices

Conclusion: 提出了旨在支持而非替代学生元认知参与的AI编程助手设计考虑因素，为开发能够加强编程教育中学习过程的教育AI工具提供了指导。

Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT now provide novice programmers with
unprecedented access to instant, personalized support. While this holds clear
promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains
underexplored. Existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability,
with limited attention to whether and how students' use of AI assistants
supports or bypasses key metacognitive processes. This study addresses that gap
by analyzing student-AI interactions through a metacognitive lens in
university-level programming courses. We examined more than 10,000 dialogue
logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and
educators. Our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with
metacognitive phases and strategies. Synthesizing these findings across data
sources, we distill design considerations for AI-powered coding assistants that
aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. Our findings
provide guidance for developing educational AI tools that strengthen students'
learning processes in programming education.

TL;DR: 提出了mmADA框架，通过主动域适应方法解决毫米波雷达人体活动识别中的域偏移问题，使用Renyi熵不确定性估计选择最有信息量的样本进行标注，结合对比学习和伪标签技术，在跨用户、位置和环境的场景中实现超过90%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达人体活动识别面临域偏移问题，即模型在新用户、新位置或新环境中性能下降。传统方法需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且不实用。

Method: 提出mmADA主动域适应框架：1）使用Renyi熵不确定性估计识别最有信息量的目标域样本进行标注；2）结合对比学习和伪标签技术利用未标注数据优化特征对齐。

Result: 在TI IWR1443BOOST雷达上的评估显示，mmADA在各种跨域设置中达到超过90%的准确率。与5个基线方法相比表现出优越的适应性能，在未见过的用户、环境和两个开源数据集上的测试验证了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: mmADA框架能够有效解决毫米波雷达人体活动识别中的域偏移问题，仅需少量标注数据即可实现高性能的跨域适应，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using mmWave radar provides a non-invasive
alternative to traditional sensor-based methods but suffers from domain shift,
where model performance declines in new users, positions, or environments. To
address this, we propose mmADA, an Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) framework
that efficiently adapts mmWave-based HAR models with minimal labeled data.
mmADA enhances adaptation by introducing Renyi Entropy-based uncertainty
estimation to identify and label the most informative target samples.
Additionally, it leverages contrastive learning and pseudo-labeling to refine
feature alignment using unlabeled data. Evaluations with a TI IWR1443BOOST
radar across multiple users, positions, and environments show that mmADA
achieves over 90% accuracy in various cross-domain settings. Comparisons with
five baselines confirm its superior adaptation performance, while further tests
on unseen users, environments, and two additional open-source datasets validate
its robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 该研究探索多模态大语言模型在分析亲子互动中联合注意力时的专家对齐能力，发现模型在观察层面比判断层面更容易与专家对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在以人为本的AI系统中应用增加，需要评估其理解复杂社会互动的能力，特别是与专家在分析早期社会沟通发展关键构造时的对齐程度。

Method: 通过与三位言语语言病理学家进行访谈和视频标注，分析其基于注视、动作和发声等观察线索的推理过程，然后使用两阶段提示法测试模型是否能近似这一工作流程。

Result: 研究发现对齐在观察层面更为稳健，专家共享共同描述符；而在判断层面，由于解释标准存在分歧，对齐效果较差。

Conclusion: 这项工作作为专家-AI在复杂社会行为中对齐的案例研究，突显了将多模态大语言模型应用于社会情境互动分析的可行性和挑战。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social
interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning
MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in
parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative
development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we
characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform
their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this
workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment.
Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer,
where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where
interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into
expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the
feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated
interaction analysis.

Abstract: More than ten thousand Chinese historical painters are recorded in the
literature; their cohort analysis has always been a key area of research on
Chinese painting history for both professional historians and amateur
enthusiasts. However, these painters have very diverse artistic styles and an
extremely complex network of inheritance relationships (e.g., master-apprentice
or style imitation relationships); traditional cohort analysis methods not only
heavily rely on field experience, but also cost a lot of time and effort with
numerous but scattered historical documents. In this paper, we propose HPC-Vis,
a visual analytical system for interactive exploration of historical painter
cohorts. Firstly, a three-stage reconstruction algorithm for inheritance
relationships of painters is proposed, which automatically converts the complex
relationship graph of historical painters into a forest structure that contains
multiple trees with clear inheriting chains, and we visually encoded this
forest as a mountain map to intuitively show potential cohorts of historical
painters. Secondly, a unified artistic style label system with three levels
(i.e., subjects, techniques, and emotions) is established by using large
language models, and it is further visually encoded as a new foldable nested
doughnut chart. Finally, a visually guided human-computer collaborative
interactive exploration mechanism is constructed, in which a painter cohort
recommendation model is designed by integrating style, identity, time, space,
and relationships. Two case studies and a user study demonstrate the advantage
of HPC-Vis on assisting historians in discovering, defining, and validating
cohorts of historical painters.

TL;DR: 提出一个集成合成数据生成的工具，改进LLM-as-a-judge评估范式，通过生成多样化测试案例来优化评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-judge范式虽然灵活，但受限于缺乏多样化、代表性数据来优化评估标准。

Method: 开发集成合成数据生成工具，支持用户创建定制化测试案例，包括可配置领域、角色、长度和期望结果（包括边界案例），并提供AI辅助编辑功能。

Result: 用户研究显示83%参与者更偏好该工具，生成数据在优化评估标准和符合人类偏好方面与手工数据效果相当。

Conclusion: 合成数据是高效且可扩展的替代方案，特别适用于效率和可扩展性至关重要的场景。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm enables flexible, user-defined evaluation, but
its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of diverse, representative
data for refining criteria. We present a tool that integrates synthetic data
generation into the LLM-as-a-judge workflow, empowering users to create
tailored and challenging test cases with configurable domains, personas,
lengths, and desired outcomes, including borderline cases. The tool also
supports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance
transparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations
behind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred
the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to
rapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The
generated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both
refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These
findings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in
contexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.

*Jaime Banks*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过访谈非专家群体，探讨他们对大型语言模型不良行为的认知，发现不良行为在一般AI讨论中不突出，但在具体情境下更显著，提出了基于道德基础理论、解释水平理论和道德二元论的AI不良行为分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于生成式AI问题功能的流行讨论很多，但缺乏对非专家如何看待AI不良行为的理解，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用归纳分析法，对28名非专家进行访谈，重点关注大型语言模型及其不良行为。

Result: 研究发现AI不良行为在一般讨论中不突出，但在提示下容易被触发，评估具体行为时更显著；观察到的不良行为类型大多与道德基础一致，普遍存在非性能和社交不协调的变体。

Conclusion: 通过整合道德基础理论、解释水平理论和道德二元论，提出了一个考虑AI不良行为的初步框架。

Abstract: Popular discourses are thick with narratives of generative AI's problematic
functions and outcomes, yet there is little understanding of how non-experts
consider AI activities to constitute bad behavior. This study starts to bridge
that gap through inductive analysis of interviews with non-experts (N = 28)
focusing on large-language models in general and their bad behavior,
specifically. Results suggest bad behaviors are not especially salient when
people discuss AI generally but the notion of AI behaving badly is easily
engaged when prompted, and bad behavior becomes even more salient when
evaluating specific AI behaviors. Types of observed behaviors considered bad
mostly align with their inspiring moral foundations; across all observed
behaviors, some variations on non-performance and social discordance were
present. By scaffolding findings at the intersections of moral foundations
theory, construal level theory, and moral dyadism, a tentative framework for
considering AI bad behavior is proposed.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨高中生在学生主导的探究式科学课堂中对Arduino技术的接受度，使用扩展技术接受模型(TAM2)作为指导框架。通过访谈和课堂观察的定性分析，发现技术接受不仅受工具性因素驱动，还受到韩国教育体系独特社会文化背景的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越传统的定量TAM研究，通过定性方法深入理解影响技术接受的情境因素，特别是在学生主导的探究式科学教育环境中。

Method: 采用扩展技术接受模型(TAM2)作为理论框架，通过访谈和课堂观察进行定性分析，研究高中生在科学课堂中对Arduino技术的接受情况。

Result: 研究发现技术接受不仅受工作相关性和输出质量等工具性因素影响，还受到韩国教育体系中大学入学考试等社会文化因素的影响。与早期研究不同，参与者认为Arduino通过可视化积木编程工具易于使用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了技术设计和教学支持在塑造学生体验中的重要性，对科学课程设计、教师准备和中学教育中公平技术整合具有启示意义。

Abstract: This study examines high school students' acceptance of Arduino technology in
a student-led, inquiry-based science class, using the extended Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM2) as a guiding framework. Through qualitative analysis of
interviews and classroom observations, we explored how students perceived
Arduino's usefulness and ease of use. Going beyond traditional quantitative TAM
studies, this qualitative TAM research provides a nuanced, in-depth
understanding of the contextual factors shaping technology acceptance. Key
findings reveal that acceptance was driven not only by instrumental factors
like job relevance and output quality but also by the unique sociocultural
context of the Korean education system, where technology use was perceived as
valuable for university admissions (subjective norm and image). Critically,
unlike earlier research that emphasized programming challenges, participants in
this study found Arduino accessible and intuitive, thanks to integrated visual
block-coding tools. These findings highlight the importance of both
technological design and pedagogical support in shaping students' experiences.
Implications for science curriculum design, teacher preparation, and equitable
technology integration in secondary education are discussed.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM是一个用于短视频评论生成的多智能体系统，支持六种不同评论风格，通过多模态大语言模型处理视频输入，在抖音和YouTube平台上获得了超过90%和87.55%的用户偏好率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台中评论在促进社区参与和内容再创作方面起着关键作用，但生成既符合平台规范又具有风格多样性和上下文感知的评论仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体系统，集成视频分割、上下文和情感分析、风格感知提示构建，支持六种评论风格（双关语、押韵、表情包应用、讽刺、普通幽默、内容提取），使用多模态大语言模型直接处理视频输入。

Result: 通过自动指标（原创性、相关性、风格一致性）和大规模人类偏好研究（40个视频、105名参与者）评估，LOLGORITHM显著优于基线模型，在抖音和YouTube上的偏好率分别超过90%和87.55%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为短视频平台上的风格化评论生成提供了一个可扩展和文化适应的框架，为增强用户参与度和创造性互动提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态语义扰动的新方法来检测视觉语言模型中的测试集泄露问题，解决了现有检测方法失效或不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于使用互联网规模且通常为专有的预训练语料库，视觉语言模型存在测试集泄露导致性能虚高的问题，而现有的检测方法对此问题研究不足。

Method: 通过故意污染开源视觉语言模型，并开发基于多模态语义扰动的检测方法，验证污染模型在受控扰动下无法泛化。

Result: 提出的检测方法在多种现实污染策略下均表现出稳健性和有效性，能够可靠地识别出被污染的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决视觉语言模型中的测试集泄露问题提供了一种简单而有效的检测方案，代码和扰动数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP是一个特征级差分隐私框架，通过两步法提升模型效用：利用基础模型根据非敏感特征估算敏感特征，然后使用改进的DP-SGD算法在原始和估算特征上训练模型，同时保护原始敏感特征的隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD对所有特征统一施加隐私保护，导致过度噪声注入和效用下降。实际场景中，只有部分特征（如人口统计属性）需要隐私保护，而其他特征（如实验室结果）敏感性较低。

Method: 1. 利用大型基础模型根据非敏感特征估算敏感特征，作为外部先验；2. 引入改进的DP-SGD算法，在原始和估算特征上训练模型，同时正式保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Result: 在PhysioNet的败血症预测任务和MIMIC-III的临床笔记分类任务上，与隐私保护基线相比，FusionDP显著提高了模型性能，同时保持了严格的特征级隐私。

Conclusion: FusionDP展示了基础模型驱动的估算在增强各种模态的隐私-效用权衡方面的潜力，为特征级差分隐私提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降阶模型缺乏稳健的不确定性量化方法，且现有方法通常受限于特定架构或训练方式，限制了灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用保形预测方法，为降阶模型管线的多个组件（潜在动力学、重构和端到端预测）估计统计预测区间。

Result: 在云微物理学的潜在空间动力学模型上验证了该方法，能够准确预测液滴尺寸分布的演化，并在整个降阶模型管线中量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种灵活且通用的不确定性量化框架，适用于各种降阶模型，无需修改模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂任务上表现良好，但由于其规模和长推理轨迹，部署成本高昂。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时降低计算开销。

Method: 使用s1.1-32B的中间表示训练轻量级预测器，预测问题难度或模型正确性，指导在推理模型池中的路由分配。

Result: 在多样化数学基准测试中，路由方法相比随机分配提高了效率，匹配s1.1-32B的性能同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 难度感知路由对于推理模型的成本高效部署是有效的。

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Conclusion: 研究结果阐明了去中心化控制的学习复杂性，可为多智能体系统中高效学习算法的设计提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线到在线强化学习中由于固定行为策略与在线学习策略之间的分布偏移带来的关键挑战，现有方法很少明确评估或利用离线数据本身的分布结构。

Method: 使用扩散模型从离线数据集中学习先验知识，通过基于能量的函数进行精炼以改进策略模仿，在在线微调期间生成离线类动作，基于KL散度将训练批次分层为离线类和在线类子集，分别采用不同的学习策略。

Conclusion: StratDiff方法通过有效利用离线数据的分布结构，成功解决了离线到在线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，为不同样本类型提供了适应性学习策略。

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

Motivation: 现实世界中的许多过程都表现出高阶机制，但因果发现中对交互作用的显式处理一直较少受到关注。

Method: 扩展因果加性模型（CAM）到包含高阶交互作用的加性模型，使用有向无环超图表示结构，开发了贪婪CAM算法的扩展版本。

Conclusion: 更严格的假设（如CAM）对应着更容易学习的超DAG和更好的有限样本复杂度，开发的算法在合成实验中表现出实用价值。

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出SADQ方法解决DQN中目标更新依赖过时策略生成的状态导致学习信号不准确和高方差的问题，通过建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布来提升Q值估计的稳定性和策略对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN从回放缓冲区采样转换进行学习，但目标更新依赖过去可能次优策略生成的下一个状态，这些状态可能无法提供有效的学习信号，导致更新过程方差高，特别是在采样转换与当前策略不匹配时问题更严重。

Method: 提出Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ)，使用随机转移模型显式建模环境动态，将后继状态分布整合到Q值估计过程中，实现更稳定和策略对齐的值更新，并探索基于建模转移结构的更高效动作选择策略。

Result: 理论保证SADQ保持无偏值估计同时降低训练方差。在标准RL基准测试和现实世界向量控制任务上的广泛实证结果表明，SADQ在稳定性和学习效率方面始终优于DQN变体。

Conclusion: SADQ通过显式建模环境动态和整合后继状态分布，有效解决了DQN中目标更新的策略不匹配问题，显著提升了强化学习算法的稳定性和学习效率。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that

*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未知转移核的马尔可夫过程快速变化检测问题，特别是在高维数据场景下避免显式似然评估的困难。

Method: 直接从样本对学习条件分数∇_y log p(y|x)，基于此开发基于分数的CUSUM程序，使用条件Hyvarinen分数差异检测核变化，并提出截断统计量确保有界增量。

Result: 证明了均匀遍历马尔可夫过程的误报时间指数下界和检测延迟的渐近上界，为高维马尔可夫模型中的分数检测提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维马尔可夫模型中的变化检测提供了理论保证和实际可行性，避免了显式似然评估的困难。

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

*Kimia Kazemian,Zhenzhen Liu,Yangfanyu Yang,Katie Z Luo,Shuhan Gu,Audrey Du,Xinyu Yang,Jack Jansons,Kilian Q Weinberger,John Thickstun,Yian Yin,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF)这一新的预测范式，用于预测早期使用渠道（如浏览量、点赞）与后期结果渠道（如引用量、销售额）之间的时间延迟关系。作者构建了两个大规模基准数据集（arXiv和GitHub），并验证了该问题在其他多个领域的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会协作平台中普遍存在早期互动与后期高影响力结果之间的时间延迟关系，但LLF问题在时间序列研究领域尚未被系统化研究，主要缺乏标准化数据集。

Method: 构建了两个高容量基准数据集：arXiv（230万篇论文的访问量→引用量）和GitHub（300万个仓库的推送/星标→分支数），并通过统计和分类测试验证了领先-滞后动态的存在，同时建立了参数和非参数回归基线模型。

Result: 研究证实了领先-滞后动态在多个领域的普遍存在，包括Wikipedia、Spotify、电子商务和LinkedIn等，为LLF研究提供了实证基础。数据集捕获了跨年度的长期动态，避免了生存偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了LLF作为一个新的预测范式，为在社交和使用数据中系统探索领先-滞后预测奠定了实证基础，并提供了公开的数据门户和文档。

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

### [175] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O. We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end, yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC, aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters, and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将分解方法引入超维计算（HDC），解决传统HDC压缩方法会缩小特征轴并削弱集中性和鲁棒性的问题。现有的HDC分解方法使用固定的原子超向量解码，不适合压缩学习到的类别原型。

Method: 提出Decomposition-based Hyperdimensional Computing (DecoHD)，直接在分解的HDC参数化中学习：使用少量共享的每层通道，通过跨层乘法绑定和最终捆绑，从紧凑因子产生大的表示空间。沿类别轴压缩，通过轻量级捆绑头保持原生绑定-捆绑-评分机制，训练端到端，推理保持纯HDC。

Result: 在严格部署预算下实现极端内存节省，仅带来轻微精度下降。平均精度保持在强非缩减HDC基线的0.1-0.15%范围内（最差情况5.7%），对随机位翻转噪声更鲁棒，使用最多约97%更少的可训练参数达到精度平台，在硬件上相比CPU（AMD Ryzen 9 9950X）实现277倍/35倍能效/速度提升，相比GPU（NVIDIA RTX 4090）实现13.5倍/3.7倍提升，相比基线HDC ASIC实现2.0倍/2.4倍提升。

Conclusion: Decomposition-based Hyperdimensional Computing (DecoHD) 是一种有效的HDC压缩方法，能在保持高精度的同时实现显著的内存节省和硬件性能提升，特别适合内存/近内存加速器部署。

Motivation: 从移动数据推断社会人口属性有助于交通规划，但由于移动模式与社会人口特征关系弱且不一致，以及跨情境泛化能力有限，这一任务仍然困难。

Method: 1. 引入基于有向移动图的高阶移动描述符；2. 开发模型置信度与准确度均衡的度量和可视化诊断工具；3. 构建多任务学习框架，从共享表示联合预测多个社会人口属性。

Result: 该方法显著提高了年龄、性别、收入和家庭结构预测的准确性，优于基线特征。多任务学习在训练数据有限或测试集分布与训练集不同时表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 提出的行为特征、不确定性量化和多任务学习方法有效解决了从移动数据推断社会人口属性的挑战，为交通规划提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and
healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient,

MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves
performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with
computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly
reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves
the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree

Conclusion: 研究为优化深度集成模型提供了有价值的见解和指导，强调了单独优化与联合优化之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD提出了一种对数类轴压缩方法，将超维计算中的内存需求从O(CD)降低到O(Dlog_k C)，同时保持维度D不变，在保持准确性的同时提高了模型的鲁棒性和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准超维计算采用'每类一个原型'的设计，需要O(CD)的内存开销，这在内存、能耗和可靠性受限的系统中成为瓶颈。现有的特征轴压缩方法虽然能减少存储和计算，但会削弱模型的鲁棒性。

Method: LogHD使用对数类轴压缩，用n≈⌈log_k C⌉个捆绑超向量替代C个每类原型，在n维激活空间中进行解码。采用容量感知码本和基于配置文件的解码方法，并能与特征轴稀疏化结合使用。

Result: 在各种数据集和注入比特翻转的情况下，LogHD在更小的模型尺寸下达到竞争性准确度，在相同内存下具有更高的弹性。在相同内存条件下，LogHD能在比特征轴压缩高约2.5-3.0倍的比特翻转率下保持目标准确度。ASIC实现相比AMD Ryzen 9 9950X实现了498倍能效和62.6倍加速，相比NVIDIA RTX 4090实现了24.3倍/6.58倍提升，相比特征轴HDC ASIC基线实现了4.06倍能效和2.19倍加速。

Conclusion: LogHD通过类轴的对数压缩有效解决了超维计算的内存瓶颈问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了能效和鲁棒性，为资源受限系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了对遗忘的原则性理解，为分析和改进通用学习算法的信息保留能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，HIF在关键指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HIF为CD模型提供了首个有效解决方案，能够响应用户数据删除请求，并部署高性能的隐私保护AI系统。

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

TL;DR: PETRA是一种基于进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列的预训练进化变换器，用于预测SARS-CoV-2的未来突变，有效缓解测序噪声并捕捉病毒进化的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2具有快速且不可预测的进化轨迹，持续出现免疫逃逸变异株，这对公共卫生和疫苗开发构成持续挑战。现有的大规模生成预训练变换器直接应用于嘈杂的病毒基因组序列存在局限性。

Method: 提出PETRA方法，基于系统发育树推导的进化轨迹而非原始RNA序列，采用加权训练框架解决全球序列数据中显著的地理和时间不平衡问题。

Result: PETRA在预测未来SARS-CoV-2突变方面表现优异，核苷酸突变的加权召回率@1达到9.45%，刺突蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%，而最佳基线分别为0.49%和6.64%。该方法还能实时预测主要进化支的突变。

Conclusion: PETRA通过利用进化轨迹而非原始序列，有效缓解了测序噪声并捕捉了病毒进化的层次结构，在SARS-CoV-2突变预测方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了LLM在边缘设备部署的关键挑战，为资源受限环境下的高效自回归推理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: DartQuant在各种模型量化实验中表现优异，使大语言模型量化在资源受限环境中变得可行。

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

Motivation: 现有基于图的方法使用固定、数据无关的惩罚机制，无法在具有不同标签和向量分布的数据集上泛化。

Method: 将问题建模为约束线性优化问题，从数据中学习向量距离和过滤器匹配之间的最优权衡权重，这些权重指导搜索过程和索引构建。

Result: 实验表明，与固定惩罚方法相比，该方法显著提高了5-10%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过适应数据的距离函数，为过滤ANN搜索问题提供了更灵活和可泛化的框架。

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

Conclusion: DeNoise框架能够有效处理训练数据被污染的情况，为图级异常检测提供了鲁棒的解决方案，在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Method: EPO通过迭代求解有限约束集的安全RL子问题，自适应调整活动集：添加违反预定义容差的约束，移除拉格朗日乘子为零的约束，防止工作集无限增长。

Result: 理论分析表明，在温和假设下，通过EPO训练的策略达到与最优解相当的性能，且全局约束违反严格保持在预定界限内。

Conclusion: EPO为半无限安全RL问题提供了有效的算法框架，能够处理连续约束空间中的安全要求，同时保证策略性能和安全性界限。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

Motivation: 许多次级和区域机场面临严重的数据稀缺问题，限制了机器学习方法的应用和大规模模拟分析能力，需要解决如何利用数据丰富机场的模型来帮助数据稀缺机场。

Result: 扩散模型仅需都柏林机场5%的数据即可达到竞争性性能，约20%数据时达到基线水平性能，始终优于从头训练的模型；潜在流匹配和潜在扩散模型也从预训练中受益，但收益变化较大；流匹配模型的泛化能力较弱。

Conclusion: 研究证明了迁移学习在ATM轨迹生成中显著减少数据需求的潜力，即使在历史记录有限的环境中也能实现逼真的合成数据生成。

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Result: GPTQ等方法在MXFP4下表现稳定，而基于旋转的方法由于全局旋转与PoT块缩放的不匹配导致性能严重下降。提出的块旋转策略显著提高了各种LLM在MXFP4下的量化精度。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者提供了明确的指导，并为新兴低精度格式下的PTQ研究奠定了基础，提出的块旋转策略有效解决了旋转方法与MXFP4的不兼容问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

TL;DR: seqme是一个用于评估生物序列设计计算方法的开源Python库，提供模型无关的指标，涵盖序列、嵌入和属性三个维度，适用于多种生物序列类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物序列设计计算方法的发展，需要统一的指标来评估这些方法的性能，但缺乏实现这些指标的单一软件库。

Method: 开发seqme库，包含序列基础、嵌入基础和属性基础三组指标，提供嵌入和属性模型、诊断和可视化功能，支持一次性设计和迭代设计方法的评估。

Result: 成功开发了seqme库，这是一个模块化、高度可扩展的开源工具，适用于小分子、DNA、ncRNA、mRNA、肽和蛋白质等多种生物序列。

Conclusion: seqme填补了生物序列设计评估工具的空缺，为研究人员提供了统一的指标库来评估和比较不同的计算方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

TL;DR: STELLE是一个神经符号框架，通过将时间序列直接嵌入到时序逻辑概念空间中，统一了分类和解释功能，提供可解释的时序分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时序分类中黑盒深度学习模型缺乏可解释性的问题，让人类能够理解模型输出的逻辑依据。

Method: 引入基于信号时序逻辑(STL)的新型核函数，将原始时间序列映射到与预定义STL公式的对齐程度，联合优化准确性和可解释性。

Result: 实验证明STELLE在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，提供逻辑上可信的解释，在多个真实世界基准测试中得到验证。

Conclusion: STELLE框架成功实现了时序分类与解释的统一，为安全关键应用提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RLHF可扩展性和PBO查询效率的混合框架，通过在RLHF流程中集成主动获取模块，实现高效样本偏好收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类偏好中学习是使机器学习模型与主观人类判断对齐的关键，但收集偏好数据成本高且耗时，需要更高效的学习范式。

Method: 将主动查询驱动的模块集成到RLHF流程中，结合RLHF在高维任务中的可扩展性和PBO的样本效率优势。

Result: 在高维偏好优化和LLM微调两个代表性领域的实验结果显示，该方法在样本效率和整体性能上均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架成功统一了RLHF的可扩展性和PBO的查询效率，为高效偏好学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法在模糊数据上性能严重下降的问题，提出了首个配备真实答案分布的模糊问答数据集MAQA*和AmbigQA*，并理论证明了预测分布和集成方法在模糊性下的根本局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法通常在无模糊性任务上进行基准测试，但真实语言具有固有的模糊性，需要评估方法在模糊数据上的表现。

Method: 引入了MAQA*和AmbigQA*模糊问答数据集，使用事实共现估计真实答案分布，评估了三种不确定性估计范式：预测分布、内部表示和模型集成。

Result: 当前不确定性估计器在无模糊性假设下表现良好，但在模糊数据上性能降至接近随机水平，这种现象在不同估计范式中一致存在。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM不确定性量化方法的关键缺陷，需要重新思考当前的建模范式以应对语言模糊性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个差分隐私的上下文学习框架，通过隐私感知的最近邻搜索来检索相关示例，在文本分类和文档问答任务中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私上下文学习方法忽略了现代大语言模型流程中的关键组件——用于检索相关上下文数据的相似性搜索，这带来了隐私风险。

Method: 采用最近邻检索从上下文数据数据库中获取相关示例，并结合隐私过滤器跟踪所选样本的累积隐私成本，以确保符合中心差分隐私预算。

Result: 在所有评估基准测试中，该方法相比现有基线有显著优势，实现了更有利的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的隐私感知最近邻搜索框架在差分隐私上下文学习中表现出色，为保护隐私的上下文学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

Motivation: 由于缺乏具有真实答案的挑战性知识图谱问答数据集，难以比较不同的知识图谱检索方法。

Method: 开发了SynthKGQA框架，可以从任何知识图谱生成合成问答数据集，提供完整的真实事实集来推理每个问题。

Conclusion: SynthKGQA不仅支持更全面的知识图谱检索器基准测试，还能训练更好的模型，为知识图谱增强的大语言模型提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

TL;DR: SCER提出了一种新的嵌入正则化方法，通过抑制虚假相关性特征来提升最差群体鲁棒性，在多个视觉和语言任务上超越了现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易依赖虚假相关性，在分布偏移尤其是子群体偏移场景下表现不佳。现有方法缺乏连接嵌入空间表示与最差群体误差的严格理论框架。

Method: 提出SCER方法，直接在特征表示层面进行正则化，通过识别领域和类别间群体均值嵌入的差异来区分核心特征和虚假特征，并施加理论约束。

Result: 在多个视觉和语言任务上的系统评估表明，SCER在最差群体准确率方面超越了先前的state-of-the-art方法。

Conclusion: SCER通过理论驱动的嵌入正则化有效提升了模型对最差群体的鲁棒性，为缓解虚假相关性问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了在联邦学习环境下，面对重尾梯度噪声的非凸-PL极小极大优化问题，提出了两种新算法Fed-NSGDA-M和FedMuon-DA，并建立了理论收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重尾噪声在非凸随机优化中受到越来越多关注，因为实证研究表明它比标准有界方差假设更符合实际情况。本文旨在解决联邦学习中重尾梯度噪声下的极小极大优化问题。

Method: 提出了两种新算法：Fed-NSGDA-M（集成归一化梯度）和FedMuon-DA（利用Muon优化器进行局部更新），两种算法都在较温和的条件下有效处理重尾噪声。

Result: 理论证明了两种算法都能达到$O({1}/{(TNp)^{rac{s-1}{2s}}})$的收敛速率，这是首个在重尾噪声下具有严格理论保证的联邦极小极大优化算法。

Conclusion: 实验验证了所提算法的有效性，填补了重尾噪声下联邦极小极大优化理论研究的空白。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有市场生成器缺乏因果推理能力，无法进行反事实分析和风险评估

Method: 在解码器架构中通过有向无环图施加因果约束，并使用因果Wasserstein距离进行训练

Result: 在受Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程启发的自回归模型上验证，反事实概率估计的L1距离低至0.03-0.10

Conclusion: 该模型支持金融压力测试、情景分析和改进的回测，通过生成尊重底层因果机制的反事实市场轨迹

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Q3R的二次重加权秩正则化器，用于低秩预训练任务，能够以规定的低目标秩训练权重矩阵，在保持预测性能的同时显著减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效训练方法在低秩预训练任务中表现不佳，难以同时维持低秩结构和训练目标。

Method: 基于迭代重加权最小二乘框架，提出Q3R二次正则化项，该正则化项主要化了一个平滑的对数行列式作为秩替代目标。

Result: 在ViT-Tiny模型上能够截断60%和80%的参数，在CIFAR-10上的准确率仅分别下降约1.3%和4%。在图像和语言任务的Transformer模型上都验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Q3R是一种有效的低秩训练技术，能够以规定的低目标秩训练模型，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数，且与现有架构完全兼容。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法公平性研究迅速发展，但在刑事司法领域关键概念仍不明确，特别是群体、个体和过程公平性之间的冲突需要解决。

Method: 开发标准群体公平性的简单修改：不要求受保护群体间的精确平等，而是在保持假阴性率差异在容忍范围内的同时最小化加权误差损失。

Result: 该方法使解决方案更容易找到，可以提高预测准确性，并凸显误差成本的伦理选择。

Conclusion: 提出了基于三个支柱的实用部署框架：基于需求的决策、透明度和问责制、精确定义和解决方案，将技术设计与合法性联系起来，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

TL;DR: 本文研究了线性模式连接（LMC）在数据偏移下的表现，发现通过小学习率和大批量大小可以减轻数据偏移的影响，这些参数决定了模型是收敛到相同局部最小值还是不同平滑度和泛化能力的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMC在数据偏移条件下的行为，理解数据偏移作为随机梯度噪声来源的影响，以及如何通过训练参数来减轻这种影响。

Method: 将数据偏移解释为额外的随机梯度噪声源，通过实验研究不同学习率和批量大小对LMC的影响，分析模型收敛到相同局部最小值或不同区域的条件。

Result: 小学习率和大批量大小可以减少数据偏移的影响，使模型更可能收敛到相同局部最小值；通过LMC采样的模型倾向于做出更相似的错误，但LMC在训练效率和更大、更多样化集成收益之间提供了平衡。

Conclusion: LMC在数据偏移下仍然有效，通过适当选择训练参数可以减轻数据偏移的影响，在训练效率和模型多样性之间实现平衡。

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图模型主要关注空间结构，将时间信息仅作为过滤约束而非建模信号，且通常设计为单任务预测。需要能够整合长距离时空依赖并支持多任务预测的通用模型。

Method: 提出时间子图采样器捕获时间相关关系；设计关系图感知器(RGP)架构，使用交叉注意力潜在瓶颈整合不同节点和边类型信息到共同潜在空间；采用灵活的交叉注意力解码器支持多任务联合学习。

Result: 在RelBench、SALT和CTU数据集上的实验表明，RGP实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RGP为关系深度学习提供了一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，支持多样化的预测任务。

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前保护生物学面临的关键挑战是缺乏物种出现数据，且人工从文献中提取数据效率低下，无法满足快速变化的环境需求。

Method: 开发ARETE R包，利用chatGPT API实现光学字符识别、数据提取和验证的自动化流程，并与人工标注进行系统比较验证。

Result: 对100种蜘蛛的测试显示，自动提取的数据使已知出现范围平均扩大了三个数量级，揭示了新的历史分布区域。

Conclusion: ARETE能够快速获取未开发的物种出现数据，改变依赖此类数据的研究项目格局，使研究人员能更好地分配资源。

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Result: 智能体能够以与外部指导强化学习相当的训练时间学习解决任务，平均目标成功率得到改善和稳定，但对单个目标的性能存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法使智能体能够被指示寻找环境中的任何观测，为特定用例之前的通用智能体训练提供了可能。

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

Conclusion: 结论强调需要关注干预引起的分布偏离问题，通过正则化方法可以提高可解释性方法的可靠性，为更可靠的解释方法指明了方向。

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the

progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散语言模型的并行采样能力，建立了采样分布与真实分布之间差异的精确数学表征，并给出了基于信息论性质的新采样边界和调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归大语言模型的推理过程本质上是顺序的，导致推理时间长且成本高。扩散语言模型（特别是掩码扩散模型）能够并行采样，但缺乏对其并行采样能力的严格理论理解。

Method: 通过建立采样分布与真实分布之间期望差异的精确数学表征，将其与单变量函数逼近理论联系起来，并基于分布的信息论性质（总相关性和对偶总相关性）设计新的采样边界和调度策略。

Result: 获得了该问题的新下界和上界，证明在某些自然设置下，可以在O(log n)步内采样而不会出现明显的性能损失，其中n是总序列长度。

Conclusion: 虽然理论上可以通过函数逼近获得最优解掩码调度，但在没有强先验知识的情况下通常无法实现；然而，基于分布信息论性质的新采样策略在自然设置下能实现高效并行采样。

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灰盒、完全三维的临近预报框架，直接处理体积雷达反射率数据，将物理约束的神经算子与数据驱动学习相结合，实现极端降水的准确预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端降水临近预报中存在局限性：数值天气预报及其深度学习模拟速度慢且分辨率低；外推和纯数据驱动模型存在误差累积和过度平滑问题；混合2D雷达方法丢弃了关键的垂直信息。

Method: 开发了三维临近预报框架，学习垂直变化的3D平流场，参数化空间变化的扩散，引入布朗运动启发的随机项表示未解析运动，使用残差分支捕捉小尺度对流启动和微物理变化，基于扩散的随机模块估计不确定性。

Result: 该框架在长达三小时的预报时间内实现了更准确的预报，在160名气象学家的盲评中，在57%的情况下排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过恢复完整的3D动力学并保持物理一致性，为极端降水的熟练可靠临近预报提供了可扩展且稳健的途径。

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Result: 55%题目区分度优秀，30%需要替换；第6题是最佳区分项；机器学习准确率达97.5%；聚类发现42.5%的自然能力分界点，与机构55%标准存在差异；两聚类方案稳定性高。

Conclusion: 多方法集成提供了强大的数学分班优化实证基础，建议替换区分度差的题目、实施两阶段评估、整合随机森林预测，以提高分班准确性和公平性。

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种直接从稀疏k空间测量生成分割的方法，无需中间图像重建步骤，能够在高加速因子下产生比基于图像的分割基线更好的分割结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高加速因子限制了MRI图像重建，当将分割模型视为后续独立过程时，这种限制也会延伸到分割模型中。

Method: 采用transformer架构将全局k空间信息编码为潜在特征，生成的潜在向量在解码过程中调节查询坐标，以生成分割类别概率。

Result: 该模型能够在高加速因子下产生比基于图像的分割基线更好的分割结果。

Conclusion: 直接从欠采样k空间样本进行心脏分割绕过了中间图像重建步骤的需求，这使得在比依赖图像输入的方法更高的加速因子下评估心肌结构和功能成为可能。

Abstract: Motivation: High acceleration factors place a limit on MRI image
reconstruction. This limit is extended to segmentation models when treating
these as subsequent independent processes.
  Goal: Our goal is to produce segmentations directly from sparse k-space
measurements without the need for intermediate image reconstruction.
  Approach: We employ a transformer architecture to encode global k-space
information into latent features. The produced latent vectors condition queried
coordinates during decoding to generate segmentation class probabilities.
  Results: The model is able to produce better segmentations across high
acceleration factors than image-based segmentation baselines.
  Impact: Cardiac segmentation directly from undersampled k-space samples
circumvents the need for an intermediate image reconstruction step. This allows
the potential to assess myocardial structure and function on higher
acceleration factors than methods that rely on images as input.

TL;DR: 本研究提出SinoFlow框架，直接从CT投影数据估计血流速度，相比基于重建图像的方法显著提高了血流估计精度，对CT成像参数变化具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT成像在心血管评估中广泛应用，但直接从对比剂演化电影估计血流速度的方法尚未开发。现有基于重建图像的血流估计方法会受到滤波反投影引入的误差影响。

Method: 使用计算流体动力学生成理想化2D血管分叉的脉动流场，模拟不同CT扫描参数下的投影数据。比较基于重建图像的PINN血流估计(ImageFlow)与直接使用投影数据的SinoFlow方法。

Result: SinoFlow通过避免滤波反投影引入的误差传播，显著提高了血流估计性能。在所有测试的机架旋转速度下都表现稳健，比ImageFlow产生更低的均方误差和速度误差。与脉冲模式成像兼容，在更短脉冲宽度下保持更高精度。

Conclusion: SinoFlow展示了基于CT的血流估计潜力，为非侵入性血流评估提供了更有前景的方法。研究结果为PINNs在CT图像中的应用提供了指导，并为基于图像的估计提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a
critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography
(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate
cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow
velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved
framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel
bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with
varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.
We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed
images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by
avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was
robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower
mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow
was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with
shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood
flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT
images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable
acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.

Motivation: 解决传统荧光分子层析成像重建中的病态性问题和对不准确或未知组织光学特性的依赖，同时克服监督式深度学习方法泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出μNeuFMT框架，集成隐式神经场景表示与光子传播的显式物理建模，在重建过程中联合优化荧光分布和光学特性参数μ。

Result: μNeuFMT即使在初始值严重错误（0.5×到2×真实值）的情况下，也能稳健地恢复准确的荧光团分布和光学系数，在数值、模型和体内验证中均优于传统和监督式深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为稳健准确的FMT重建建立了新范式，为复杂临床相关场景（如荧光引导手术）中更可靠的分子成像铺平了道路。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow

is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.
